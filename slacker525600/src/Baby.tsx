/*
Current idea is to provide an easy to use baby size comparison application.
lets start with on/off,
then move to days since fertilization yielding mass
then move to all the other things (types/weightvslength/)
then worry about UX of interaction of above ... ratios lulz

lets do this with hooks ...
, useEffect, useState

export interface BabyProp {
  // noted above path forward, starting with on/off bool and number
  days: number
};
*/

const Baby: FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>Hello World</div>
  )
}

export default Baby
