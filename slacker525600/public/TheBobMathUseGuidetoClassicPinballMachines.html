Note</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hi, I&rsquo;m Bob Matthews, a.k.a. BobMathUse, a.k.a. BMU [high score initials]. &nbsp;I started playing pinball in 1972. &nbsp;It was 10 cents a game, all Electro-Mechanical games, &ldquo;EMs&rdquo; for short. &nbsp;The machines were add-a-ball only, since replays were not permitted where I lived in upstate New York. &nbsp;(Fortunately, upstate and New York City often disagreed on things, and still do; there was no issue with pinball&rsquo;s legality where I was.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To make my dimes go the furthest, I had to strive for long games. &nbsp;This is some of my accumulated knowledge from the past 50 years. &nbsp;My ideas aren&rsquo;t always perfect, nor my execution of them, but they&rsquo;ve worked pretty well for me. &nbsp;In some cases, expert players may have different opinions on choices of shots or which flipper techniques to use than what I describe here. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s fine; if you find or hear of something better that works for you, use it! &nbsp;If you find the tips here help you, you&rsquo;re welcome, and spread the word. &nbsp;And if you want to pass this along to someone or somewhere else, go ahead, as long as it&rsquo;s attributed to me.</span></p><p class="c37"><span class="c8 c15">Overview &ndash; Electro-Mechanical &ldquo;EM&rdquo; Games</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I begin this guide with games produced in the late 1960&rsquo;s, when pinball had evolved enough to have skill play a major role. &nbsp;(If you want to know about earlier games, there are plenty of pinball history books.) &nbsp;At this stage, the games were all &ldquo;Electro-Mechanical&rdquo; amusement devices. &nbsp;These &ldquo;EM&rdquo;s, for short, were made up until early 1978. &nbsp;About 90% of the ones you&rsquo;ll see on location or at tournaments or shows were made by either Gottlieb, Williams or Bally. &nbsp;Most of those which are &ldquo;competition suitable&rdquo; in terms of design, maintainability and &ldquo;skill&rdquo; date from 1965 and later, skewing towards the latter years. &nbsp;All have mechanical scoring reels which rotate vertically to advance in value. &nbsp;Some have an indicator light to show when a player has &ldquo;rolled over&rdquo; the score, typically at a value of 100,000, but most have no indication when a player rolls the game a second time. &nbsp;Most EM games have manual coil plungers, but a few older ones automatically plunge the ball when you hit one of the flippers, usually the right one, similar to the autoplunger buttons on newer games like Attack from Mars. &nbsp;Older games may also have a push-up trough where the player must first push a lever on the right side of the machine cabinet to raise a ball into the plunger lane prior to pulling the plunger to serve the ball. &nbsp;These machines will either show the balls yet to be plunged through a glass window in the lower front of the top of the game surface or, if one ball is continually recycled, indicate the ball count at the lower left just below the glass surface.</span></p><p class="c37"><span class="c8 c15">Overview &ndash; Solid-State &ldquo;SS&rdquo; Games</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the late 1970&rsquo;s, manufacturers changed how scores are displayed on pinball machines, abandoning the use of rotating mechanical reels and replacing them with brand new digital displays using solid state electronics (hence the vintage&rsquo;s name, Solid State). &nbsp;The advent of such electronics and other advances enabled manufacturers to incorporate new playfield and scoring features into the games. &nbsp;The use of multiple levels of bonus multipliers became easier to implement and more common in use. &nbsp;Drop targets were used in new ways &ndash; in line rather than always side-to-side; targets that popped back up when not hit in the correct sequence; drop targets with stand-up targets hidden behind them. &nbsp;Multiball play became more common, though still not pervasive as it is today. &nbsp;Sound effects became more varied, and speech was added. &nbsp;Mechanical push-ups of balls into the plunger lanes were gone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Despite all that, the general strategies remained similar on many games to that of the EM era: &nbsp;shooting the ball &ldquo;up top all day&rdquo; a.k.a. UTAD to have it bounce around and hit many scoring features; completing sets of drop targets; going for lit spinners; building and collecting bonus. &nbsp;All of these continued to be high-value choices.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Many solid-state games emphasize &ldquo;bonus and multiplier&rdquo; strategies. &nbsp;The multiplier usually maxes out at 5X or 6X. &nbsp;Some have a &ldquo;superbonus&rdquo; feature where once a certain bonus level is reached, that amount of base bonus is preserved for the remainder of the game. &nbsp;Some games may instead preserve your achieved multiplier. &nbsp;A few games preserve both.</span></p><p class="c37"><span class="c8 c15">Overview - General</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Almost all of the machines mentioned here lack &ldquo;tilt warnings.&rdquo; &nbsp;Modern games make a buzzing or other sound when shaken to alert you that you are about to tilt the game. &nbsp;This gives you an opportunity to stop shaking and possibly avoid tilting if the shake triggering the warning was not too severe. &nbsp;These older games are more binary: &nbsp;the game tilts with no warning to the player. &nbsp;Furthermore, on the older EMs, a tilt may end the game even if you are not on your last ball. &nbsp;If &ldquo;tilt ends game&rdquo; is active, either the machine will have text mentioning that on its instruction card or the competition director should have placed a sign on the machine to so notify the players.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I will be using a fair amount of &ldquo;pinballese&rdquo; here, e.g. terms like shatzing or alley passing (defined below), and abbreviations like SDTM (Straight Down The Middle, as in that&rsquo;s where the ball may go in the situation at hand, ending play of that ball or the game) and UTAD (Up Top All Day, meaning that the best strategy to use at that point in your game is to flip the ball up to the top of the machine and ignore lower features and targets). &nbsp;I also am omitting photos both to save space and because I do not possess photos of many of the games I&rsquo;ve included. &nbsp;For both a good pinball glossary and useful photos of most machines, I recommend using the Internet Pinball Database [ipdb.org]. &nbsp;I will include explanations of a few terms here when I think they may not be in ipdb or if I use them somewhat differently.</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c8 c15">Preview and Basic Principles</span></p><p class="c12 c18"><span class="c32">1.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">When in doubt, UTAD - - Up Top All Day. &nbsp;Shoot the ball up towards the top of the machine, through a spinner or over some other kind of high-value switch if possible, and better yet if that spinner or switch has been raised to its maximum value. &nbsp;Take whatever path to the top is the safest and or easiest to shoot if there are no significant value differences among paths.</span></p><p class="c12 c18"><span class="c32">2.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Nudging: &nbsp;as mentioned above, most older games have NO tilt warnings. &nbsp;You find out you shook it too hard when your ball, or the entire game, suddenly ends. &nbsp;Nudge, but don&rsquo;t vigorously shake. &nbsp;Those &ldquo;slide the game sideways&rdquo; moves you can make on many modern Stern machines won&rsquo;t work here, you&rsquo;ll tilt. &nbsp;One-time bumps on the side or front of the game should suffice. &nbsp;On many games, a large fraction of your final score will come from end-of-ball bonuses. &nbsp;For these, avoiding tilting is more important than you&rsquo;re probably used to. Where there is no end of ball bonus, desperation shoves are worth a try if it&rsquo;s your last ball, or if the penalty is only the end of the ball currently in play (some games take the ball in play plus a second ball as a tilt penalty).</span></p><p class="c12 c18"><span class="c32">3.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">If there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;collect bonus&rdquo; shot and your bonus is close to maximum, shoot it. &nbsp;There are some exceptions, but I&rsquo;ll cover these game by game.</span></p><p class="c12 c18"><span class="c32">4.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">If there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;light double bonus&rdquo; shot lit, shoot it.</span></p><p class="c12 c18"><span class="c32">5.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Completing sets of things (targets of a given color or suit, lanes, saucers, etc.) is generally better than a random mix of each item.</span></p><p class="c12 c18"><span class="c32">6.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">One some machines, there is a way to &ldquo;close&rdquo; or &ldquo;zip&rdquo; the flippers so they are closer together and the ball cannot fall through between them. &nbsp;If there&rsquo;s a shot to do this, you should usually shoot it. &nbsp;Similarly, if there&rsquo;s an &ldquo;up post&rdquo; shot to raise a center post between the flippers, make that if you can. &nbsp;Once you have the flippers closed (&ldquo;zipped&rdquo;) or the post up, it&rsquo;s usually good to let the ball drop onto them, then take your time setting up your next shot.</span></p><p class="c12 c18"><span class="c32">7.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">If there&rsquo;s a shot or a nudge that gets the ball back to the plunger lane, do so.</span></p><p class="c0 c18"><span class="c32">8.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">When shooting for bumpers, whether normal or &ldquo;mushroom&rdquo; bumpers, try to make the hits grazing ones where the ball will continue upwards after hitting the bumper. &nbsp;(See El Toro, Fireball, Cosmos, etc.] &nbsp;A direct hit on the bottom of a bumper may cause the ball to be kicked out the center or side drain by the bumper.</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c8 c15">&ldquo;Go-To Flipper&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On many machines, there&rsquo;s an imbalance as to which flipper you&rsquo;ll want to use most often. &nbsp;Either the more important shots face one flipper, more shots overall are made from one flipper, or the shots are easier or safer with one flipper than the other. &nbsp;For any such game, use the ball control skills below to get the ball to the desired flipper. &nbsp;If you could flip the ball with the less desirable flipper but could also tip or dead bounce the ball to the more useful flipper, don&rsquo;t flip! &nbsp;Dead bounce, tip, or otherwise transfer the ball instead. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t have to swing at every pitch here; just keep the ball in play and work to tee it up for a precise shot at what&rsquo;s most valuable at the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For each game in this guide, I have listed what I consider to be the &ldquo;go-to&rdquo; flipper. &nbsp;&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; &ldquo;Left,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Balanced&rdquo; are self-explanatory. &nbsp;For some games, I list it as &ldquo;mild bias Right&rdquo; or Left. &nbsp;This generally means that it&rsquo;s not worth special effort to try to get the ball on one flipper vs. the other, nor to transfer a ball cradled on one flipper to the other one. &nbsp;Its meaning is more that when the ball is moving such that you can easily get it to either one, choose the mild bias flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In other cases, which flipper should dominate changes during the course of game play, e.g. Right flipper early on and Left flipper after certain goals are achieved. &nbsp;These are noted as such, often specifying the goal(s) that trigger the switch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Occasionally, you should try to transfer the ball to the &ldquo;go-to&rdquo; flipper even if you already have it safely cradled on the other flipper. &nbsp;Most of the time, I&rsquo;ve indicated this in the text, but since I added this item well after building out the guide, many of the earlier entries might not explicitly say this. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll need to interpret my intent. &nbsp;These older Classics games are less suitable for many types of flipper-to-flipper transfers, though; post passes and alley passes might not be possible due to the machine&rsquo;s design.</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c8 c15">Ball Control</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Use &ldquo;dead bounces&rdquo; to pass the ball across to the other flipper and get to a cradle. &nbsp;A dead bounce is when you let a ball falling towards a flipper hit it </span><span class="c5 c9">without</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;flipping so that the ball bounces off of it and across to the other side, where it will often roll up just past the other flipper. &nbsp;You can then raise the other flipper and get the ball to settle down onto that flipper to take a more controlled shot. &nbsp;Most older games have relatively dead flipper rubber so that such bounces are unlikely to go up into the slingshots and out of control as is sometimes the case on modern games. &nbsp;But be careful &ndash; if the rubber is too dead, the ball may just die down the center.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When you have the ball cradled on a flipper, you often can&rsquo;t transfer it to the other flipper using a post pass as you would on more recent machines. &nbsp;There may be no posts, or they may be too high up, or too close, or the flippers unsuited for making that move. &nbsp;Your two basic alternatives are tap passing (soft late flip) and alley passing a.k.a. shatzing (an end-of-the-flipper shot into the opposite flipper lane). &nbsp;Bally games are more likely to accommodate tap passes due to the flipper construction. &nbsp;Williams games more often can apply shatzing. &nbsp;Gottlieb games&rsquo; flippers generally don&rsquo;t tap pass well, and results are mixed on alley passing. Mini flippers (2 inches long versus standard 3 inches) on any model don&rsquo;t tap pass as well as full-size ones, but you may be able to alley pass or use micro-flips as described below.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Drop catching, live catching and especially dead bounces will be very useful but beware the &ldquo;dead catch&rdquo; or &ldquo;death bounce.&rdquo; &nbsp;Sometimes the flipper response will be so slow after a catch that the ball will roll off the end of it before you can flip. Or the flipper rubber will be so dead that the bounce off of it won&rsquo;t make it across to the opposite flipper, just die down the center. &nbsp;Watch and learn from the player ahead of you if you can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Micro-flipping. &nbsp;On several games, the ball can come to rest between either the tips of the two flippers, when in a &ldquo;closed flippers&rdquo; position, or between a flipper and a center post. &nbsp;When you have a chance to let the ball do this, take it unless it&rsquo;s easier to get the ball directly to a flipper cradle. &nbsp;Once the ball is there, use tiny flips to nudge it to a spot where you can either cradle it on the opposite flipper (Time Zone), or take a shot as it rolls up the other flipper if that&rsquo;s more advantageous (Fireball). &nbsp;This is one skill or feature that&rsquo;s absent from modern games.</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c8 c15">Playing Style - Control vs. Flow</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c2">On most pinball machines you should try to get control of the ball, cradle it on a flipper, then make a precise shot at a specific objective. &nbsp;Not all games are best played that way, though, and it&rsquo;s good to know when to change techniques. &nbsp;Some games are best played with a &ldquo;flow&rdquo; style, where you flip the ball almost immediately after it touches a flipper. &nbsp;There are some simple ways to tell when this may occur. &nbsp;The clearest cases are when there&rsquo;s little or no chance to cradle the ball in the first place. &nbsp;This can occur when there&rsquo;s a gap behind the flipper elbows, e.g. Doodle Bug, when the flippers are angled so low you can&rsquo;t readily get the ball to sit on them, e.g. Scuba, and when the game has the short 2&rdquo; flippers with little room above them for the ball to settle down (note to self, find best example).</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c2">There are also games where you can play control style but often shouldn&rsquo;t depending on the ball&rsquo;s motion. &nbsp;These occur when there&rsquo;s a risk of the ball rolling up the flipper and out of play behind it on games like Grand Prix (both flippers) and Trident (right flipper). &nbsp;There are also times when you should use &ldquo;flow&rdquo; style to provide extra energy to your shots. &nbsp;Trident&rsquo;s left flipper is one case of this, where the ball enters a chute above it and comes racing down towards it, providing you a chance to shoot the spinner. &nbsp;Flipping at the moving ball increases the speed of the shot, giving you a chance to earn more spinner points.</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c2">There are games where flow style helps you make shots you otherwise can&rsquo;t. &nbsp;This often happens on very old games with weaker flippers, more often the 2&rdquo; size than the 3&rdquo; size. &nbsp;Just as in baseball a swing at a pitched ball will make the ball fly further than just tossing it in the air and hitting it, flipping at a ball coming at the flipper will provide both flipper power energy and rebound off the flipper rubber energy, enabling you to get the ball higher up onto the playfield than you could from a cradled shot. &nbsp;On games where UTAD (up top all day) is key more so than making specific shots, this can be very important.</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c2">Lastly, there are special cases where you need to play &ldquo;flipper defense&rdquo;. &nbsp;On Spanish Eyes, for example, balls bouncing off the bottom center bumper can be propelled past the flippers into either side outlane if you don&rsquo;t take a swat at them as they go by.</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c8 c15">Shot Selection and Aiming</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Ever watch golf on TV? &nbsp;If so, you&rsquo;ve probably heard an announcer talk about the &ldquo;correct miss.&rdquo; &nbsp;This refers to when you take a shot that may not go exactly</span><span class="c5 c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">where you want it to: &nbsp;what happens when you miss your target by a modest but not severe amount? &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re nowhere close to target, e.g. 50+ feet off in golf, you may be in a lot of trouble, but that&rsquo;s due to missing that badly, and you&rsquo;ll pay the price. &nbsp;But when you miss by 10-20 feet, i.e. you&rsquo;re reasonably close, can anything bad happen? &nbsp;If the hole is near the edge of the green and there&rsquo;s a sand trap next to that edge, you&rsquo;ll see pro golfers target a spot between the hole and the center of the green, rather than the hole itself, so that if they miss, they&rsquo;re not in the sand trap. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Pinball has similar situations. &nbsp;For instance, when shooting the ball up a side orbit to the top of the game, if you miss high, the ball may hit a post and rebound dangerously, while if you miss low, the ball may hit the side of the machine and go partway but not all the way up to the top. &nbsp;The basic strategy is that while trying to hit your exact target, time your shot to favor missing to the &ldquo;safe&rdquo; side. &nbsp;The better your aim is, the closer to dead center you should. &nbsp;(Exceptions are when you get a better rebound by hitting the edge of something.) &nbsp;The worse or less consistent your aim is, the more you need to consider which way to miss &ndash; right or left with bottom flippers, high or low with upper flippers. &nbsp;If one way is safer than the other, aim a shade to the safe side of center.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you&rsquo;re shooting at a bank of targets, all of equal value, start nearer the middle if your aim is so-so; that way if you miss the center one, you&rsquo;ll likely still hit a target to the side of the center one. &nbsp;If your aim is better and some targets are &ldquo;easier&rdquo; to hit than others for whatever reason, try to start with the harder ones. &nbsp;Usually the hardest targets are the highest one, when weak flippers strain to make it up there and only a perfect shot will do, or the lowest one, where a post or other feature may block the lower edge of the target (e.g. #4 on Centaur).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Flipper Choice. &nbsp;Many shots can be hit with either flipper. &nbsp;There is usually a &ldquo;better&rdquo; flipper to choose for the shot, and it may not be the obvious choice. Novice players generally don&rsquo;t use &ldquo;backhand&rdquo; shots, and even middle-tier players don&rsquo;t use them as often as they should. &nbsp;When there is a choice, consider these things:</span></p><p class="c12 c16"><span class="c5">1.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">How easy to hit is the shot from each flipper?</span></p><p class="c12 c16"><span class="c5">2.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Where does the rebound go from each?</span></p><p class="c12 c16"><span class="c5">3.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Can I safely transfer the ball from one flipper to the other before choosing which flipper to use?</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c5">4.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Is it better to shoot with the ball stopped on the flipper in a cradle position or with the ball moving down (or up) the flipper? &nbsp;A moving ball has more energy and is often necessary to hit some shots.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Speaking of moving balls having more energy, there&rsquo;s a technique that&rsquo;s much more useful on EMs than on many recent machines, which I as a &ldquo;flow&rdquo; player use frequently. &nbsp;I call it a &ldquo;flying backhand.&rdquo; &nbsp;This is when the ball is moving towards a flipper from the opposite side of the playfield and rather than try for a cradle, dead bounce, or normal forward flip, I wait until the ball is near the flipper surface and then try to flip it up and backwards. &nbsp;This can improve my chances for some shots, not so much when shooting at specific targets as when trying to go UTAD or to get the ball into a narrow chute. &nbsp;Another reason to use the flying backhand is sheer physics: &nbsp;the ball will have more energy and go higher up or hit harder than a shot from a cradle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One example is RoGo. &nbsp;When shooting up top, forehand shots to the opposite side of the playfield must negotiate a sharp angle. &nbsp;A ball going up top from the same side as the flipper is on has a much more open entry to the gap. &nbsp;The catch is, you either can&rsquo;t flip the ball up that way from a cradled position on the flipper at all or else if you tried, it wouldn&rsquo;t go up as far as needed because the ball is standing still to start and flipper power is limited. &nbsp;Spanish Eyes and Liberty Belle are a few other games where the flying backhand is useful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On modern games, the flying backhand tends to be less useful, since it&rsquo;s often hard to hit a ramp shot that way, and orbit shots tend to be aligned to be more makeable from the normal opposite-side flipper.</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c8 c15">Plunging</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skillful ball plunging is more important on EMs than on later games, although it&rsquo;s coming back into vogue on some new games. &nbsp;In many cases, you need to get the ball into each of several different lanes at the top of the game for maximum scoring, and it is often difficult if not impossible to get the ball back through a top lane from below during play.</span></p><ol class="c36 lst-kix_ielri0l5qcnm-0 start" start="1"><li class="c25 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;Use the markers in the plunger lane to change or repeat a plunge to a specific goal. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a good idea to use practice time to find out which marker plunges to which lane or other location at the top of a machine.</span></li><li class="c25 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Know when to &ldquo;short plunge&rdquo; or &ldquo;soft plunge,&rdquo; i.e. plunge just barely enough to put the ball into play. &nbsp;This is often to get the ball to land in the right-hand-most lane or feature at the top of the machine. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s useful on many EMs, like Flip-A-Card and Solid States, like Eight Ball.</span></li><li class="c25 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Learn to &ldquo;thumb plunge.&rdquo; &nbsp;At times, the ideal plunge is a maximum force plunge. &nbsp;While you can achieve this by banging the plunger with your fist, it&rsquo;s safer for both your hand and the machine to use a different technique. &nbsp;Pull the plunger ball all the way with your left hand while placing your right thumb on the plunger&rsquo;s outer face and your right fingers on the game&rsquo;s top above the plunger lane. &nbsp;Simultaneously let go of the plunger with your left hand and push in with your right thumb. &nbsp;The result will be a ball that rockets into play. &nbsp;It can be a more accurately repeated plunge than even using the markers at times, so if it goes where you want it, use it.</span></li><li class="c25 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">Know your plunging goals. &nbsp;Besides getting the ball to land in a particular lane or saucer, it may be optimal to have it hit something else along the way first, e.g. also hit some rollovers above the lanes, or hit some upper rubbered switches to change which top lane is lit or change the value of a top saucer before the ball lands in either.</span></li></ol><p class="c29"><span class="c8 c15">Common Playfield Features</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">EMs and Solid States have fewer types of playfield features than later games; technology takes time. &nbsp;Here are the features you&rsquo;ll find most often:</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c5">1.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Lane Sets</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Often used to advance the Bonus Multiplier [or light a lane to do so], or to increase the value of drop targets or other playfield features. &nbsp;On some games, scoring a top lane will light a corresponding lower lane below for increased scoring. &nbsp;If so, there may be a top lane you should try to score first since the lane below which it lights is more likely to be scored later than the others. &nbsp;Example: the center lane on Royal Guard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">2.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Drop Target Sets</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On most EMs, there is no scoring advantage to hitting targets in any particular order. &nbsp;[Sample exception: &nbsp;Sinbad] That doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s not a best order to hit them in, however! &nbsp;Some targets are more dangerous than others due to where the rebounds tend to go. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll deal with that by machine if needed. &nbsp;Otherwise, watch your rebounds and learn what&rsquo;s riskiest on your particular game. &nbsp;Avoid those targets if feasible, otherwise get them last.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On SS games, there may be a preferred target order, usually left-to-right or vice versa. &nbsp;There may also be one set of targets that is more valuable than the other(s), either all of the time or during specific times. &nbsp;For instance, on Joker Poker, each set of drops of a given card type [10-J-Q-K-A], lights your 5X bonus on a different ball in play. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Drop Target values may vary depending on what you&rsquo;ve done before you hit them. &nbsp;Games where this is critical include:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Volley -- targets are worth 500 without the matching colored lane, 5000 with matching lane</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Jacks Open -- targets are worth 1000 plus 1000 per completed lane up to 3 lanes; completing the 4</span><span class="c5 c23">th</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;lane resets the lanes and target values</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Card Whiz -- targets are worth 1000 plus 1000 per completed lane up to 3</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Jumping Jack - targets are worth 100 in bonus, 1000 if lit saucer collected</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Several games have drop target-based end-of-ball bonuses. &nbsp;In some cases, complete sets matter [High Hand &ndash; 10 times the value for complete suits]. &nbsp;In other cases, they don&rsquo;t [El Dorado].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">3.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Inline Drop Targets</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On several solid-state games, notably Ballys, a series of 3 or 4 drop targets are positioned in a mostly vertical row one behind the other. &nbsp;They are most often used to increase your bonus multiplier, e.g. on Paragon, the first two targets are just points, then the next two give you 2X and 3X bonus, and finally the saucer behind the targets gives you 5X bonus. &nbsp;Some sets are 2-3-5, some are 2-4-6, some are 2-3-4-5, some like Paragon have one or two non-multiplier targets first. &nbsp;In each case, though, they are a primary goal for you on those machines. &nbsp;For some of these games, the path behind the targets is open, leading to the top of the machine; this is usually also a good thing to shoot for. &nbsp;In other cases, there&rsquo;s a dead-end behind them, with a standup target of some kind set there; these are usually valuable, too. &nbsp;Other example games include Eight Ball Deluxe, Future Spa, Dolly Parton, Black Pyramid, Viking, Frontier, Harlem Globetrotters, Flash Gordon and Hotdoggin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">4.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Vertical Spinners</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Flaps hung above the playfield that spin when the ball travels through them. &nbsp;When spinners are single-valued, they are usually not worth shooting. &nbsp;Most spinners, though, are dual-valued, e.g. 100 per spin unlit, 1000 when lit or 1K unlit and 10K lit. &nbsp;A few machines even have 3 or 4 spinner value levels. &nbsp;Somewhere on the game surface or instruction card will be text telling you how to light the spinners for their higher value(s). &nbsp;On some games, the spinners when lit are highly valuable compared to other features and are &ldquo;safe&rdquo; shots in that the ball goes up to the top of the game through them vs. a shot at a drop target where the rebound can drain. &nbsp;On these games, the optimal strategy often becomes &ldquo;light spinner(s), then shoot spinners all day.&rdquo; &nbsp;Grand Prix is one of the best-known examples of this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Be aware that not all spinners are created equal: &nbsp;some spin many more times per hit than others, i.e. they&rsquo;re &ldquo;juicy.&rdquo; &nbsp;The juicier a spinner is, the more valuable shooting it becomes as a strategy. &nbsp;Spinners which just flip a few times before they stop may not be worth your effort, and an alternate strategy should be chosen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">5.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Horizontal Spinners</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Disks set into the surface of the playfield that spin when you hit either of two posts on their edges positioned 180 degrees apart. &nbsp;They are usually used to build bonus of some kind, and can rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on how and where you hit them. &nbsp;While most vertical flap spinners are designed to be spun almost exclusively by shots from the flippers, horizontal spinners can also be spun when the ball bounces into them off slingshots, bumpers or other playfield features. &nbsp;Such bounces can also cause them to stop spinning or even reverse direction if they are spinning when hit a second time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When shooting at horizontal spinners, you need to consider three factors for your shots: &nbsp;the angle of the line between the posts relative to the flipper; which direction you want the spinner to spin; and where the rebound from the shot might go. &nbsp;If the line between the spinner posts is roughly perpendicular to the flipper you have the ball on, you&rsquo;ll get more spins from your shot. &nbsp;You make the spinner rotate clockwise with a shot to the left post and counterclockwise with a shot to the right post. &nbsp;If the posts are nearly aligned with you, a shot may just kick right back at the flippers without causing the disk to spin much, if any, and risks a center drain. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t shoot at the spinner when it&rsquo;s at such an angle; shoot the ball elsewhere and wait for a random bounce to realign the spinner for you. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since shots directly at the center of a post regardless of angle may bounce downwards, and possibly drain, you usually want to hit the post slightly off center. &nbsp;Consider both &ldquo;slightly off center&rdquo; and &ldquo;just grazing&rdquo; shots, taking into account where the rebound from your intended shot is likely to go. &nbsp;If there&rsquo;s a bumper just beside and behind the post, for instance, you may want to hit the post so that the rebound will avoid the bumper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">6.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Rollover Buttons</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Less common, these can be asterisk-shaped disks with slightly raised centers [Jungle King], lozenge-shaped disks about &frac12; inch wide [Satin Doll], or small tabs &frac14;&rdquo; wide [Hang Glider]. &nbsp;They often advance your bonus or spot a number / card / letter. &nbsp;On machines which have a large number of these, it&rsquo;s usually a good strategy to hit as many of them as possible. &nbsp;Where there are fewer such buttons, they can often be ignored.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">7.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Bumpers</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unlike most modern games, on EMs, the scoring from bumpers can sometimes be a significant fraction of your game&rsquo;s total. &nbsp;Lighting bumpers to increase their value by a factor of 10 can be important. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s also not unusual to have some bumpers worth more than others in a game, e.g. some be 10 points when unlit and 100 lit, others 100 unlit and 1000 lit. &nbsp;Bumpers are rarely high in relative value on the later SS games.</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c5">8.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Waterfalls a.k.a. Plinko Lanes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Example games: &nbsp;300, Atlantis, Centigrade 37 and Sing-Along. &nbsp;These are a series of lanes, usually two parallel sets on the right-hand side set one below the other, typically 3 or 4 pairs. &nbsp;There may be a gate below the bottom right lane that can be opened to return the ball to the plunger lane. &nbsp;The ball can drain out the [right] side if it comes down the outer lowermost lane and there is no open gate protecting it. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re usually valuable to shoot at, but their value must be weighted against the chance that the ball drains if it exits the lowest set of lanes the wrong way.</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c5">9.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Saucers</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">These come in two basic physical types: &nbsp;sharp-edged ones just slightly larger than the pinball [High Hand, Snow Derby], and shallow bowl-shaped ones [Little Chief, Strato-Flite]. &nbsp;Some just award points, although their value may change [Snow Derby again]. &nbsp;Others may cycle through different awards of either points, bonus advances, playfield features [open gate] or some combination thereof. &nbsp;Some may collect bonus. &nbsp;See what it does when you shoot it; it may be the most important shot on the game. &nbsp;The bowl-shaped ones are more likely to have the ball rim out and not fall in; watch out for that. &nbsp;The sharp-edged ones have a smaller feed-in area but are more likely to actually catch a ball once it&rsquo;s there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">10.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp; Locked Ball Saucers and &ldquo;Lock Stealing&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Some saucers are used to lock balls for multiball play. &nbsp;Locking a ball when the saucer is ready to do so is almost always a good thing to do. &nbsp;The ready state is sometimes indicated by the saucer being lit; on other games, it&rsquo;s always ready to lock a ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Some machines that have lock ball saucers allow &ldquo;lock stealing.&rdquo; &nbsp;This occurs when one player shoots a ball into the lock but does not release it to start multiball before their turn ends. &nbsp;On many EM and SS games, that ball can be released by the next player, or by any other player after that, thereby giving them a multiball instead of the player who locked the ball. &nbsp;This alters the strategy of play when it occurs; for instance, if you begin your turn while there is a ball locked by a previous player, your best move is often to start that multiball right away. &nbsp;Whenever playing such a game, check the ball lock status before beginning your turn. &nbsp;Some examples are Fireball, Fathom, Space Shuttle, and Taxi.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">11.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp; Ball Return Gates</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A wire gate, usually at the lower right, where the ball will return to either the plunger lane or the flipper if the gate is open vs. draining out the side if the gate is closed. &nbsp;If the game has such a gate, you usually want to open it a.s.a.p.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">12.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp; Slingshots</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Many EM games have relatively weak slingshots, mostly due to age; this still happens for solid state games, but far less often. &nbsp;In machines where there are no return lanes, e.g. the bottom configuration is outlane-left sling-left flipper-center gap-right flipper-right sling-right outlane, you&rsquo;ll often find the ball bouncing softly back and forth between the slingshots. &nbsp; Situations like this are where the &ldquo;art of nudging&rdquo; came to the forefront. &nbsp;Your goal in such situations is to nudge the machine (or not) when the ball hits the slings in order to get the ball to either settle gradually down to where it will be shootable with a flipper, or climb up and rise above the slings, but not go into either outlane. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s kind of like riding a swing as a child - - you &ldquo;pump&rdquo; the swing / sling to rise up (*or pull to drop down), but here, there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;no fly zone&rdquo; at the top of the sling where the ball must not go lest it drain. &nbsp;It you&rsquo;re in rising mode, once the last hit was just below the top of the sling, the next one needs to clear the outlane gap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Examples: &nbsp;Drop-A-Card; Flip-A-Card; Fun Land</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">13.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp; Roto-Targets</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">These are spinning targets where a vertical or horizontal rotating disk has just a few of the targets on it exposed to the playfield surface at any time, the remainder being either underneath the playfield or blocked by posts or other objects at the edges of the area above the playfield. &nbsp;Shots can be made at any given time by hitting one of the exposed targets in the gaps. &nbsp;The disk is stationary when you are about to shoot at it - - it spins after the ball goes through an indicated lane or hits a target. &nbsp;You may also collect the item indicated in one of the gaps by having the ball go through a lane, hit a different target, land in a saucer elsewhere on the playfield, or drain in a linked outlane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Examples: &nbsp;Close Encounters; Spin-Out; Torch</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">14. &nbsp;Random Value Features [Spinners / Targets / Saucers]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Some game features award a random value when scored. &nbsp;Do the math. &nbsp;If the values are 5, 50 or 500, treat it as worth 185, i.e. use the average value. &nbsp;Then prioritize your shots using that average value vs. the fixed-value shots.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Examples: &nbsp;Fun Land spinners; &ldquo;300&rdquo; and Soccer bonus-add saucers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">15. &nbsp;Vari-Targets</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">These are metal pads set in angled channels that you can push back via a flipper shot into the channel. &nbsp;The &ldquo;vari&rdquo; part comes from the fact that their value varies depending on how far back you push the pad - - further is more. &nbsp;The strength of the flippers, narrowness of the channel and stiffness of the target pad will all affect how easy it is to score on these.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Examples: &nbsp;Baseball; Orbit; Pro Football</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">16. &nbsp;Variable Award Lanes or Chutes or Switches</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Examples: &nbsp;Sea Ray, Knockout, Heat Wave</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A few games have channels which can give you something or not, but which appear to be random as to when they are available. &nbsp;Most such games have a set of gears inside which simulate randomness; they actually do have a pattern, but their mechanics makes it a long enough one to not be worth trying to memorize, nor can you always tell where you&rsquo;re starting in the cycle. &nbsp;Sea Ray is a good example, where the wavy chute on the left can award up to 4 different things. &nbsp;The gearing, linked to the ten-point switches in this case, can light the chute for 0, 1, 2 or all 4 features. &nbsp;Each ten-point switch advances the cycle. &nbsp;A few steps actually do not change the chute status, but about 90% do. &nbsp;For games with this feature, if you want to collect or enable one or more awards via the chute, all you can do is keep shooting the ball towards the chute and hoping that you trigger just enough switch changes en route to light what you want as the ball enters it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Similarly, some games don&rsquo;t have simple on-off toggles for their bumpers, but a geared semi-random pattern. &nbsp;Heat Wave has its bumpers so wired. &nbsp;In this case, make the most of the top when lots of bumpers are lit.</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c8 c15">Bonus</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Many EM and SS games are bonus-heavy, i.e. a large portion of your score will come from bonuses, usually collected at the end of a ball, sometimes coming from a collect bonus shot during the play of the ball, and sometimes both. &nbsp;You need to know several things about each game&rsquo;s bonus:</span></p><p class="c12 c16"><span class="c5">1.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">What shots add bonus?</span></p><p class="c12 c16"><span class="c5">2.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">What is the maximum [base] bonus?</span></p><p class="c12 c16"><span class="c5">3.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Is there more than one bonus?</span></p><p class="c12 c16"><span class="c5">4.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">If there&rsquo;s more than one bonus, can you make progress on all of them at once, or only one at a time?</span></p><p class="c12 c16"><span class="c5">5.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">If only one at a time, what changes which bonus is active?</span></p><p class="c12 c16"><span class="c5">6.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Is bonus collected at the end of the ball?</span></p><p class="c12 c16"><span class="c5">7.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">If collected at the end of the ball, are all bonuses collected or only the active bonus?</span></p><p class="c12 c16"><span class="c5">8.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">Can you collect bonus before the end of the ball?</span></p><p class="c12 c16"><span class="c5">9.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c2">What shots light collect bonus [if present]?</span></p><p class="c12 c16"><span class="c5">10.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">What shots collect bonus?</span></p><p class="c12 c16"><span class="c5">11.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">If you collect bonus before the end of the ball, does the bonus value reset to its starting amount or stay at the value collected?</span></p><p class="c12 c16"><span class="c5">12.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Can some or all of your bonus value be held to the next or to all future balls?</span></p><p class="c12 c16"><span class="c5">13.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">What shots activate &ldquo;hold bonus&rdquo; [if present]?</span></p><p class="c12 c16"><span class="c5">14.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Are there one or more threshold bonus amounts which, if met, will hold a &ldquo;super bonus&rdquo; over to future balls?</span></p><p class="c12 c16"><span class="c5">15.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Is there a bonus multiplier?</span></p><p class="c12 c16"><span class="c5">16.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">If there&rsquo;s a multiplier, how many levels?</span></p><p class="c12 c16"><span class="c5">17.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">What shots increase the bonus multiplier?</span></p><p class="c12 c16"><span class="c5">18.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Is the bonus multiplier held to future balls?</span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c5">19.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Does the bonus multiplier reset to 1 or to some less-than-maximum value on the ball after you raise it to its maximum value?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus values are usually shown on the playfield surface through lights corresponding to the value earned so far. &nbsp;In some cases, you&rsquo;ll need to add the value of two or more lights to get the total bonus, e.g. a game may have a bonus that maxes out at 29,000 and have a 20,000 light and a 9,000 light lit to indicate it; a 15,000 max indicated by a 10,000 light and a 5,000 light is another common combination. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;ve earned double [or triple, etc.] bonus, a separate light [usually colored] on the playfield will show that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you look at final game scores relative to the maximum bonus that can be earned, you can get a good idea of how important building bonus on that game. &nbsp;For instance, on a 5-ball game where your maximum bonus is 15,000 and there&rsquo;s no multiplier, if the top scores are around 100K, bonus is probably the most important thing on that game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If a game has a &ldquo;collect bonus&rdquo; shot, it&rsquo;s usually worth trying to light it, if necessary, and shoot it once your bonus is near maximum value. &nbsp;On most machines, the bonus value will remain where it was after you make such a shot; on some games, the bonus value is reset to the minimum amount after you make the shot. &nbsp;I say &ldquo;usually&rdquo; above because the value reset situation creates a notable exception - - games where the bonus resets _and_ you have the ability to double or triple the end of ball bonus. &nbsp;These games include Cherry Bell, Mars Trek, Monaco and Super Straight [all Sonic/Segasa machines]; I&rsquo;ll deal with this situation in the individual discussions for those games.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Some games have a &ldquo;hold bonus&rdquo; feature. &nbsp;Hold bonus means that whatever end of ball bonus you&rsquo;ve earned is carried over to the next ball in play; otherwise, bonus resets to zero or a base amount like 1000 after each ball. &nbsp;If a shot to activate hold bonus is available, it&rsquo;s usually good to take it as soon as you can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Solid State games may also have a &ldquo;super bonus&rdquo; feature, where if one has achieved a high level of base bonus, a large part of that base will be preserved for the remainder of the game. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s fairly common on Bally solid-state games in particular. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s an important goal to achieve when present.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c15">Add-A-Ball Game Considerations</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Many older games are what&rsquo;s known as &ldquo;add-a-ball&rdquo; games, built for times and locations where winning a free game was prohibited. &nbsp;In some cases, they can be played much the same as their free-game siblings, but not always. &nbsp;For several machines here, your scoring strategy is impacted by the way add-a-balls work. &nbsp;This is most commonly seen on 1970&rsquo;s Gottlieb games; examples include Captain Card, Gold Strike, Target Pool and Free Fall. &nbsp;For games like these, one major objective is to complete a set of targets or lanes. &nbsp;Once completed, one or more targets or lanes on the playfield will light to award additional balls to play. &nbsp;This is different from the &ldquo;Same player shoots again&rdquo; extra ball, where at the end of the ball in play, it returns to the shooter lane with the ball counter unchanged, e.g. you&rsquo;re still on ball number 2. &nbsp;Add-a-balls increase the number of balls remaining to be played, up to a maximum of not just the 3 or 5 you started the game with but as many as 10 balls. &nbsp;Winning just one add-a-ball is equivalent to &ldquo;same player shoots again,&rdquo; but earning more than one lets you extend your game much further. &nbsp;This was done to compensate for not being allowed to win free games. &nbsp;By allowing multiple add-a-balls, a player could extend their playing time within a single game to double, triple or more, providing a poor-man&rsquo;s version of the extra game play earned by winning free games.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When present, what typically happens when you enter add-a-ball mode is that you score zero points for whichever features award add-a-balls, getting additional balls to play instead. &nbsp;In a competition where add-a-balls are either turned off or forced to be plunged, this means you get little or no point value from them. &nbsp;In a few cases, this is a big deal; one striking example is Captain Card. &nbsp;On that game, the collect bonus features (the center saucer and the two outlanes) become the add-a-ball shots when you complete all 16 drop targets. &nbsp;They suddenly change from the most valuable things on the playfield to the least valuable point-wise. &nbsp;Gottlieb games typically have the add-a-ball activation features reset at the end of the ball during which they were completed, which at least lets you resume scoring progress. &nbsp;But the cost of completion can be high in lost scoring opportunity. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re better off not-quite-finishing the set in such cases.</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c8 c15">Game Condition</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">By definition, Classic games are now at least 35 years old, some over 50. &nbsp;Things wear out. &nbsp;Flippers, slingshots, bumpers, rubbers and other playfield parts don&rsquo;t last forever. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a good chance that the machine won&rsquo;t play as it did when it was brand new. &nbsp;In fact, none of the machine operators I knew back in the 1970&rsquo;s thought that many (if any!) of those machines would still be in use 10 years from then, let alone 40. &nbsp;No arcade I visited at the time had machines more than 5-10 years old in it even though pinball games had been around for a couple of decades. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know what the intended useful life span of the games was at the time they were built, but I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re long past it. &nbsp;EM games, being older than SS, are more prone to such problems, but beware of them on both types.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What things about a machine have changed with time and how will that affect how the game plays? &nbsp;Here are a few I see often:</span></p><p class="c0 c30"><span class="c8 c5">Weak flippers</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">This is the most common flaw - - flippers that have worn out. &nbsp;This can result in some shots being much harder to make, or more dangerous to take, than was intended when the game was built. &nbsp;Some of the shots you would normally take may be completely unhittable; others may be makeable, but only at much higher risk than as designed, e.g. more likely to miss and with a greater drain risk if you do miss or even if you hit the shot. &nbsp;If your flippers are weak, you may need to adjust your strategy to taking 2</span><span class="c5 c23">nd</span><span class="c5">- or 3</span><span class="c5 c23">rd</span><span class="c2">- best shots rather than the best ones if those are all you can make repeatedly. &nbsp;Your ability to transfer the ball between flippers may also be reduced.</span></p><p class="c0 c30"><span class="c8 c5">Cratered lights</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Many games have little circles in the lower center area of the playfield where, for instance, the amount of bonus you have earned thus far during your latest ball in play, or which letters of a set you&rsquo;ve collected so far, may be displayed. &nbsp;Over the years, these discs tend to sink into the wood surface of the playfield, creating moon-like craters in the otherwise flat playfield surface. &nbsp;When the ball rolls over these, it will deflect along the curve. &nbsp;Unfortunately, many of these discs are directly above the gap between the flippers, and the way they deflect the ball can cause it to drain down the center when it would normally have rolled towards a flipper without the cratering. &nbsp;This can be repaired, but it takes time and money to do so, and in many cases the owners will leave the game as is. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s not much you can do about it other than be alert for it and, if it is present, do your best to deal with it by nudging.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This can also be a problem with the outlanes, where a similar disk above the outlane switch indicates its value. &nbsp;Originally, with that area flat, a ball heading into the outlane might have bounced off the side wall hard enough to come back to the adjacent return lane and roll down to your flipper. &nbsp;A cratered disk in an outlane will tend to &ldquo;grab&rdquo; the ball and keep it in the outlane far more often.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c5">Non-registering switches</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Some playfield features may not register when the ball contacts them - - rollovers and targets may have reduced sensitivity and either not register at all or, more commonly, only register particularly strong hits to them. &nbsp;Again, there&rsquo;s not much you can do other than be aware of it and allow for it in your strategy. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a related thing to watch for, slow switches. &nbsp;If you hit one target and the ball quickly rebounds into a second target, the machine may not score fast enough to register the second target value. &nbsp;Pinball rules do not allow for adding the &ldquo;should have been&rdquo;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c5">Outlane pins and posts</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On a few games there are thin pins that can deflect a ball that might drain back into play. &nbsp;As the machine ages, these may get bent such that they do not deflect the ball back as often, or at all in extreme cases.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c5">Weak or dead bumpers and slingshots</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A worn-out old bumper or slingshot will not kick the ball as hard or as far as it was originally designed to. &nbsp;As a result, it may send the ball towards a drain or some other undesirable place. &nbsp;This is yet another thing to watch out for and try to avoid or nudge to mitigate. &nbsp;In some instances, a weak bumper or slingshot may actually work in your favor by either slowing the ball down to make it easier to control or directing it to a safer location than it normally would.</span></p><p class="c0 c30"><span class="c8 c5">Slippy Saucers</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Games with saucers that the ball lands in get wear around the saucer edges. &nbsp;For the tight sharper-edged saucers, there&rsquo;s rarely a problem, but for the flatter open saucers it can be. &nbsp;The saucer edges get smoother from wear, making the ball more likely to slip out rather than fall into the saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Summary:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">What to do with such well-worn games? &nbsp;If the guidance given here isn&rsquo;t working, change tactics, technique or both. &nbsp;Keep in mind </span><span class="c17 c5">why</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I gave the guidance I did, though, e.g. if UTAD or the spinner or a certain drop target bank is where the points are, try to find an alternate way to get those points safely. &nbsp;If you can&rsquo;t do so safely, choose the next-most valuable objective to go for. &nbsp;Take what the machine gives you and make the most of it.</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c8 c15">Nudging and &ldquo;Key Feeds&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unlike more recent games with ramps and orbits, on EM and SS games, few if any shots will return safely to a flipper. &nbsp;Shots will bounce off of things or go through things. &nbsp;When they rebound or exit, it&rsquo;s important to learn where the ball goes and how much you can alter that. &nbsp;Some rebounds and exits are relatively consistent, some not. &nbsp;Rebounds will depend on speed and angle of hit and whether or not the thing hit hits back; exit paths may depend on how the ball entered the feature, how fast the ball goes through, and whether or not it hits any post, knob or other object at the exit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A &ldquo;key feed&rdquo; is where the ball goes after you make an important shot that you&rsquo;ll be repeating often. &nbsp;[See El Dorado, Wizard, Card Whiz.] &nbsp;It&rsquo;s important to learn &ldquo;feed nudging,&rdquo; particularly for key feeds. &nbsp;When the ball goes through a feed, you want it to come to where you can control it if possible, at a minimum prevent it from draining, and usually avoiding it heading into and triggering a slingshot or other playfield feature where it may bounce away randomly. &nbsp;The nudge-or-not decision may depend upon how the ball entered the feature or its speed: &nbsp;On El Dorado, if the ball goes down the right side through the outer [right] lane, it will be moving faster and cleaner than if it goes through the left of the two right-side lanes. &nbsp;The faster feed may come out clean and travel to a flipper, while the slower feed may dribble out and hang up on top of the slingshot, where it can rattle off and drain out to the right. &nbsp;Also, timing may be critical, e.g. you may want to nudge just as the ball hits a post, the top of a slingshot, etc.</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c8 c15">Machine Settings and Instruction Cards</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Settings matter even on EMs - - while new games have far more selectable options, older games had some, even if you had to physically move a switch rather than push buttons and use menus. &nbsp;It can be important to note how your game is set. &nbsp;Some of these are obvious, for instance how many or which items of type A need to be scored to activate a change to how item type B scores.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Each game should have an &ldquo;instruction card&rdquo; visible under the glass at the bottom of the game near the flipper buttons. &nbsp;EMs had few enough &ldquo;rules&rdquo; that the some of the more important ones could be shown on a simple index card. &nbsp;Not all machines will have one, though, since they often got lost or damaged over the years. &nbsp;When they are present, they&rsquo;ll give you partial guidance as to what to do but are usually not as detailed as this guide nor do they indicate which of the several choices are the most valuable or the &ldquo;safest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c9">The instruction card may not accurately reflect how that machine is set.</span><span class="c5">&nbsp; In many cases, the card will not be the original one, or it may reflect a different number of balls, for instance showing the rules that apply to a 5-ball game vs. a slightly different set of rules that apply to a 3-ball game. &nbsp;The card may be the rules for the &ldquo;other&rdquo; of the free-game or the add-a-ball version of the machine. &nbsp;The machine owner and or tournament director may have changed the settings on the game from the factory originals. &nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c9">Do not presume</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;that the instruction card you see, if any, is 100% accurate for the game in front of you. &nbsp;Take it as a starting point but be sure to note what the game actually </span><span class="c5 c9">does </span><span class="c2">as you play it -- ideally, by watching while someone else is playing!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Both EMs and SS games also usually have lettering on the playfield surface that indicates scoring opportunities. &nbsp;It never hurts to &ldquo;read the machine&rdquo; when such text is present. &nbsp;In some cases here where two machines are almost identical in play, differing mostly in the number of players or in artwork, I simply list as the near-duplicate machine as &ldquo;see Other Machine&rdquo; rather than duplicate the text. &nbsp;In these cases in particular, you should check the playfield text for any minor differences.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c15">Classics Guide &ndash; Historical Commentary</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">First, let&rsquo;s look at how many games made it into my guide by year. &nbsp;Until the late 1960&rsquo;s, most games involved relatively little skill, so few from this period are represented even though actual production numbers were often high. &nbsp;Most of those games are long since discarded. &nbsp;The first year with more than five machines here is 1968 with 9 titles. &nbsp;The numbers grow from there, reaching 31-34 games each year from 1977 through 1980, then rapidly declining. &nbsp;The most noticeable change is the sharp drop off from 33 in 1980 to just 15 in 1981. &nbsp;1980-1981 was when the first big video game wave hit, PacMan in 1980 in particular. &nbsp;Pinball machines were suddenly the #2 game in town.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">People often ask me what my favorite games are. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s hard to answer, since I favor some for their &ldquo;fun-ness&rdquo; and others for their &ldquo;skill-ness.&rdquo; &nbsp;Unlike some websites (e.g. IPDB), I give almost no weight to artwork or sound in this regard. &nbsp;Here are my Top 50 Classic Games; I do take the state of the art at the time the game was produced into account. &nbsp;My EM and SS Top Tens are </span><span class="c17 c5">underlined</span><span class="c2">. &nbsp;Note that 1980 was an exceptional year in terms of the number of high-quality games produced. &nbsp;No year before -- or since, including &ldquo;moderns&rdquo; -- had as many tournament-worthy titles made. &nbsp;Pinball &ldquo;peaked&rdquo; this year in many ways, just as the video game craze was about to overtake it. &nbsp;(Other noteworthy 1980 titles in this guide but not in my top 50 include Big Game, Cheetah, Counterforce, Panthera, Quicksilver, Scorpion, Spiderman and Xenon. &nbsp;1980 was also easily the best year for wide-body machines with 11 in this guide.)</span></p><p class="c31"><span class="c8 c5">Electro-Mechanical Games</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c2">1968 &nbsp;

that held championships in D.C. in 1972 and 1973 and the &ldquo;American Pinball Association&rdquo; that ran the US Open in 1980, but none persisted. &nbsp;Player-organized events were rare. &nbsp;The tournament director(s) would never be participants; they were operators or owners, not players.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">The most common format for events in those days was qualifying across multiple games based on position points followed by playoffs on only one or just a few games. &nbsp;For qualifying, the arcade would select some portion of their games for use, and players would get points for being among the top 10 scores on each game. &nbsp;Sometimes you got one try, sometimes multiple tries, once in a while unlimited tries over a week or month. &nbsp;A typical point scheme would be 15-12-10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1. &nbsp;The top 8 or 16 or 25 players - - the number of qualifiers varied - - would be instructed to return for the playoffs on a designated date if the event took more than one day. &nbsp;Playoffs were sometimes head to head, sometimes ranked scores across either several machines or one machine with multiple tries on it totaled, sometimes both, e.g. narrow it down to the top 4 with a fresh ranked score round, then have the top four play in the finals. &nbsp;One major difference with today is that the players </span><span class="c17 c5">never</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;got to choose what machines to play. &nbsp;They generally didn&rsquo;t get to choose position, either, that being fixed based on their qualifying rank - - you played in reverse qualifying order, high qualifier last.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">For a few events, the qualifying phase was simply &ldquo;get the high score on one of the games here.&rdquo; &nbsp;All the high score people would then play one or more games on a designated finals machine, in random order on the first pass, highest total to date last on multiple passes. &nbsp;Your total score for the (one or more) games of the finals determined your order of finish. &nbsp;The 1980 US Open used this format.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Prizes were generally modest, since most events had little or no entry fee, you just paid the coin drop to play the games and maybe $5 or $10 in some cases to register. &nbsp;A typical single-location event would have either zero or a $5 fee and a top prize of perhaps $100. &nbsp;A state-level AMOA event would give away a new machine to the winner, such as a Bally Wizard in 1975. &nbsp;The US Open was a rare exception with a first prize of a then-huge $5,000 (a new car in 1980 cost a bit over $7,000).</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">An interesting bit of trivia here relates to &ldquo;plunging off.&rdquo; &nbsp;In modern events, if the last player has already scored more prior to playing their last ball than any of the other players scored for their completed games, that player can &ldquo;plunge off&rdquo; ball 3 (or ball 5 for an EM machine) since they don&rsquo;t need any points on their last ball to win. &nbsp;In these earlier events where you totaled the scores or points across multiple games, it was possible for a player to in essence &ldquo;plunge off&rdquo; their entire final game if their accumulated score or point total already exceeded that of all other players. &nbsp;While this can still be done now in some formats, e.g. when using PAPA-points, the winning player&rsquo;s score in the final game today can still impact where other players finish, so plunging off their last game is discouraged. &nbsp;That was not a problem in these earlier events where everyone&rsquo;s finishing position would already be known using this format in such cases.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Tournament &ldquo;rulings&rdquo; were relatively rare; what happened, happened. &nbsp;If the ball got stuck, you were expected to try to nudge it loose unless it was in a really gnarly spot; in that case, yes the glass would be removed, but the ball was then usually placed in the plunger lane for simplicity. &nbsp;Compensation balls? &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t recall encountering a compensation ball prior to the 1990&rsquo;s. &nbsp;Tilt-throughs were automatic losses. &nbsp;Extra balls, if earned, were always played, never plunged. &nbsp;Some games had ball counts that went as high as 10; Gold Strike, the add-a-ball version of El Dorado, is one. &nbsp;The game starts you with 5, but you can build that up as high as 10, play it back down, then build it up again. &nbsp;You got to play whatever you earned. &nbsp;Games would play as arcade-normal most of the time; in rare cases, they might tighten the tilt. &nbsp;There were no &ldquo;tournament settings&rdquo; nor removal of posts, rubbers, etc.</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c8 c15">Machine Etiquette</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When you encounter these games today, treat them with respect. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re probably older than you are, and certainly have seen a lot of wear and tear over the years. &nbsp;Even if restored, they&rsquo;re vulnerable to damage and breakdowns. &nbsp;Whoever has brought the game to a show, tournament, or placed it in an arcade deserves to have their property, put there for your enjoyment and that of the people who come after you, played nicely. &nbsp;If your game ends sooner than you wanted, don&rsquo;t abuse it. &nbsp;If the machine does something it&rsquo;s not supposed to, let someone know. &nbsp;If the ball gets stuck, nudge it but don&rsquo;t thrash the machine around to free it, get a technician to help. &nbsp;As Rudy from Funhouse would say, &ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s only pinball!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c8 c15">Parting Words / Disclaimer / Feedback</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I wrote this guide to make older electromechanical and solid-state games more fun for people to play by making them more understandable. &nbsp;If you know the goals on a game and the means and techniques to achieve them, any pinball machine becomes more fun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I have omitted numerous machines, especially earlier EMs, due to their infrequent appearance at tournaments, shows or on location. &nbsp;Other machines have been omitted because they are &ldquo;luck boxes&rdquo; where you just flip the ball into the bumpers and pray for lots of action before the ball comes back down. &nbsp;If you come across a game that you think should be included here, though, let me know and I&rsquo;ll consider it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This guide, while comprehensive, is not perfect. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve done my best to make it accurate, but as I mention in the instruction card section, the individual game unit you happen to be playing may not perform exactly as described here. &nbsp;I may have missed something or misremembered it; owners, operators and tournament directors can and do make alterations to games for various reasons; 40- or 50-year-old machines can develop bugs and not function as built. &nbsp;Treat this document as a guide, not an absolute. &nbsp;Remember that what the machine really does is the final say on your score.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In response to requests for a &ldquo;condensed&rdquo; version of the guide, I have a &ldquo;Quickie Version&rdquo; at the beginning of the section for each game. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve kept all of the details in for those interested in the more in-depth analyses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m interested in how well this guide works for people who use it. &nbsp;If you find something you&rsquo;d care to add or correct, pass it along to me. &nbsp;While I&rsquo;ve played all of these games, in some cases it has been many years since I last did so. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve omitted some details when I couldn&rsquo;t remember them with certainty, e.g. whether the bonus maxes out at 19,000 vs. 15,000 in a few cases. &nbsp;If you see one and have the correct information, let me know and I&rsquo;ll update it. &nbsp;Thanks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c35">Specific Game Guides</span></p><p class="c0 c28"><span class="c8 c19"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">3 Jokers [EM - Williams, 1970]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;left orbit all day</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Shot to Master: &nbsp;Left Orbit</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill shot: &nbsp;get any lit lane at the top; the harder ones are to the left, so try to get those first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On Straight Flush, the goal is to collect all five cards. &nbsp;Each has a lane at the top, but they can also be scored via the center saucer. &nbsp;You get 100,000 [or an extra ball, depending on settings] for the set of five. &nbsp;You also get 100K for scoring all three jokers via the center saucer, and 100K for the left orbit when lit for Special.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Each top lane or card lights the bumper below it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On the right side are Up Post and Down Post standup targets, which raise and lower the center ball-save post. &nbsp;Like many other games with center posts, you can let the ball settle between either flipper and the post when it&rsquo;s up, then use soft flips to set up shots.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center saucer scores the card indicated by the pointed arrow below it. &nbsp;The arrow moves one position clockwise whenever you hit either of the two Advance standup targets near the top or go over either advance rollover button. &nbsp;The arrow does not advance when you score the saucer. &nbsp;You also score the arrowed card when the ball goes through the &ldquo;spot card + 5000&rdquo;

it goes on and off based on 100&rsquo;s digit of your score, apparently lit for two digits out of the ten. &nbsp;You may find that shots up top via the left orbit tend to bounce into one or two of the card lanes more often than the others. &nbsp;If so, skew your plunges to get the other cards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Don&rsquo;t worry about the center saucer; the ball will wander into it periodically after bouncing around in the bumpers. &nbsp;Treat getting cards or jokers from the saucer as a fringe benefit but not a goal. &nbsp;The kickout from it should go cleanly to the left flipper.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">4 Million BC [EM - Bally, 1971]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;zip the flippers closed, shoot the volcano and tar pit to lock balls, advance the tar pit via the center bumper until achieving multiball. &nbsp;Repeat. &nbsp;Lock balls for more Skill Shots whenever possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This game and the more often seen Fireball each employ a &ldquo;top of the cliff&rdquo; Skill Shot. &nbsp;The goal is to plunge the ball just hard enough to go up to the top of the ramp, then fall back down the ramp. &nbsp;On this game, you get 100 points for each of the first three switch levels on the ramp that you trigger on the way up or down. &nbsp;If the ball touches the upper fourth switch, this changes the value of the three lower switches to 1000 points each - - but you can only score these if the ball falls back down the ramp to the left. &nbsp;If the ball goes over the cliff to the upper right, you don&rsquo;t get those points, and the ball goes into the pop bumpers, netting you 310 total [300 on the way up, 10 as you exit into the bumpers]. &nbsp;If the ball goes up to the topmost of the three switches but doesn&rsquo;t reach the fourth switch, you&rsquo;ll score 600 - - 300 on the way up, 300 on the way down. &nbsp;Shorter plunges will score less.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After making the Skill Shot, your first priority is to close or &ldquo;zip&rdquo; the flippers. &nbsp;You do this by shooting either the left one of the two red stand-up targets or the right one of the two yellow mushroom bumpers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shooting the Volcano saucer on the left will lock a ball. &nbsp;You receive a random value award of 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 or 5000 when you release the ball from the saucer. &nbsp;The ball is released by shooting the right mushroom bumper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Tar Pit gate opens when you plunge the ball. &nbsp;When you shoot it the first time, a ball will lock above the catch in the upper level. &nbsp;Do this - - more skill plunges for points! &nbsp;The tar pit gate will then close, and the kickback should come on. &nbsp;The center open-flippers bumper advances the ball down the tar pit; three advances release it from the tar pit for multiball. &nbsp;You can therefore get either a 2-ball or 3-ball multiball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The general strategy is to make the Skill Shot, close the flippers, use microflips to get the ball to a cradle, lock a ball in either the volcano or the tar pit. &nbsp;Repeat Skill Shot and closing flippers, lock the other ball. &nbsp;Repeat Skill Shot, close flippers, hit center bumper to advance ball in tar pit. &nbsp;Re-close the flippers, repeat twice to release the ball in the tar pit for a 2-ball multiball. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;ll hit the bumper to release the ball in the volcano during your two-ball multiball and end up with three balls. &nbsp;Relock a ball in the tar pit or volcano if you can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Just keep repeating Skill Shot, close flippers, lock balls, release balls as many times as possible. &nbsp;In a well-played game, most of your points will come from Skill Shots and locking balls. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a good game for learning Skill Shot precision and ball control.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">4 Square [EM - Gottlieb, 1971]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Finish exactly three sets of &ldquo;1-2-3-4&rdquo;

set #2 increases the yellow targets; set #3 increases the green targets. &nbsp;Completing a fourth set actually hurts your scoring opportunities, since the green targets now change to &ldquo;special,&rdquo; which is a free game in location play but worth nothing in tournament play. &nbsp;I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it much, though, since to collect points, you need to keep scoring numbers. &nbsp;Just try to postpone finishing that fourth set and shoot all but one of the four numbers as much as you can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The key feeds on this game are when the ball comes out of the side 1, 2, 3 or 4 lanes. &nbsp;It will hit the rubber post below the lane and bounce off the top of the triangle [2 and 3 lanes] or slingshot [1 and 4 lanes] below. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll need to learn how to &ldquo;read&rdquo;

This game has a rare &ldquo;ball count&rdquo; bonus display feature, inside the backglass. &nbsp;Your bonus is one thousand per ball shown in the window. &nbsp;You want to get the bonus up close to its maximum of 10K, collect it, and repeat that process. &nbsp;The collect part is important since you can&rsquo;t advance the bonus beyond 10K - bonus advance shots don&rsquo;t add any bonus at that point. &nbsp;If your bonus is at 10K, collecting it is your absolute priority.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Primary feature: &nbsp;the two saucers at the upper left. &nbsp;The left saucer collects and resets your bonus, plus giving you 1000 points. &nbsp;The right saucer randomly adds 1K, 2K or 3K to your bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is built many ways. &nbsp;The center spinner advances bonus 1K per five spins. &nbsp;The return lanes, outlanes, upper left lane and standup targets all advance it 1K when lit. &nbsp; The right side of the game is a set of eight lanes in four side-by-side pairs. &nbsp;These are lit crosswise, i.e. either (top-left) + (second-right) + (third-left) + (bottom-right) or vice versa. &nbsp;If you shoot the ball into these, you&rsquo;ll want to keep it in the lit lanes to add bonus, so nudge accordingly. &nbsp;The bottom right lane drops to a gap between the right return lane and a rubbered post and will drain if not nudged properly, unless the gate is open.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The upper left lane, below the saucers, opens that gate at the right outlane; you want that gate open whenever possible. &nbsp;The lane can&rsquo;t be reliably shot directly, but you can nudge the ball in when it&rsquo;s bouncing off the left bumper. &nbsp;If the ball is in the vicinity, try to do so!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;I like to go for the left of the two top lanes; the ball will fall onto the right pop bumper from there, and I try to nudge the bounce off the bumper into the upper [right] add-bonus saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Right flipper: &nbsp;shoot for the saucers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Left flipper: &nbsp;shoot the spinner to advance bonus and get the ball rattling in the bumpers where it might bounce into a saucer or over to the left to open the gate. &nbsp;You can also consider shooting for the eight right side lanes, but I suggest doing so only when the crosswise sequence has the top right lane lit. &nbsp;The ball usually goes in there when you shoot it up that way, so you&rsquo;ll likely get at least one advance, up to four if the ball falls through the sequence of lanes optimally. &nbsp;This sequence has the right return lane lit, too, which is where you want the ball to go if it falls through all four levels of lanes rather than bouncing out into the center of the playfield. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball Control: &nbsp;do NOT hold the right flipper up to roll the ball up to a cradle: &nbsp;it will often go up and out the gap at the right side of the wire form. &nbsp;Live catches and drop catches are fine but use caution so you don&rsquo;t accidentally do the roll-out.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">2001 [EM - Gottlieb, 1971]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD via bank shots off the drop target banks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center saucer is always worth 300. &nbsp;This is your Skill Shot on ball one. &nbsp;Once other saucers are lit, you want to change your Skill Shot to a different saucer [see below].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">The other 4 top saucers are worth 300 AFTER you&rsquo;ve completed the 5 drop targets of the corresponding color, e.g. 5 green targets down lights the green saucer, worth only 50 until then. &nbsp;This means that, given a choice of drop targets to hit, </span><span class="c17 c5">finish a color set</span><span class="c2">. &nbsp;Completing a color also lights the lane of that color for 300 vs. 50 points. &nbsp;The upper colors, green and red, are better to get first since these each lights a return lane, while the lower banks each light an outlane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The kickout from the center saucer goes onto the upper right sling, but usually not causing a hard-enough kick to keep the ball up top. &nbsp;Unless the sling on your machine is snappy enough to keep the ball up top, prepare for nudging as it comes down. &nbsp;You want the ball to bounce off the red or yellow targets, or the rubber behind them, just enough to roll gently down the face of the lower slings to the flipper. &nbsp;Too hard a bounce will go down the middle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The kickouts from the other four color saucers will hit a top bumper; depending on the exact alignment, you can sometimes nudge the rebound back into a saucer [may be a different saucer]. &nbsp;If so, do as often as you can, and also change your Skill Shot to aim for that saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Avoid the 4 standup targets facing you in the center. &nbsp;These are only useful on location when they award a replay or extra ball when lit [if turned on].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball control: &nbsp;you usually can hold the flipper up and pass the ball across when it is rolling down the return lane. &nbsp;The choice of doing this or not goes with what targets you need to complete a color set first.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Abra Ca Dabra [EM - Gottlieb, 1975]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;finish sets of four numbers and all ten drop targets as many times as possible, hitting the center standup target to reset the drop targets when completed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Shots to master: &nbsp;the center stand-up target to reset the drop targets; shooting the ball up through the outer 1 and 4 lanes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;whichever number you don&rsquo;t already have. &nbsp;Try for something other than the 4 on ball one, since you can always soft plunge for the 4 later if needed. &nbsp;On a few Abras, a plunge into the 1 or 4 lane will occasionally drain down the middle; if yours does that, go for the 2 or 3 instead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You want to do two things here: &nbsp;hit the lit targets and try to get the ball to go through all four numbered lanes, either at the top or near the flippers at the bottom. &nbsp;The &ldquo;bonus value,&rdquo; shown in the bottom center of the playfield, is what hitting a lit target is worth - - 1K to 5K - - vs. 500 for unlit targets. &nbsp;Switch hits change the lit target, so it will eventually cycle to light each of them in turn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Finishing 1-2-3-4 instantly scores the bonus value and raises it to the next level until it maxes out at 5000. &nbsp;So, like some other EM games, scoring certain lanes or lane sets first make [some] targets worth more. &nbsp;The other way to raise the bonus value is to knock down all of the drop targets on both sides, then shoot the center standup target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If the flippers are in good condition, it IS possible to shoot the ball up the 1 and 4 lanes directly, but you&rsquo;ll find that you can also go up the 2 and 3 lanes! &nbsp;This can happen when you have knocked down the center couple of drop targets on either side and then shoot the ball that way again: &nbsp;it can hit the rubber behind where the targets were and rebound towards and up the 2 or 3 lane off the curved center divider. &nbsp;You can also use shatzing to get the 1 and 4 lanes at the bottom of the game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you are close to completing all of the drop targets, go ahead and shoot the remaining few, even if none of the remaining ones are lit, to raise the bonus value and reset the bank so that at least one target standing on each side will be lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Numbers carry over from ball to ball, so finish the set a.s.a.p. &nbsp;Shoot up the 1 and 4 directly if you can, and bank the ball off the drops up the 2 or 3 if you can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Abra Ca Dabra, when playing fast with strong flippers, is a good tournament game, rewarding precision drop target shooting.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Aces &amp;

or &ldquo;light yellow joker&rdquo; lane. &nbsp;That makes the saucer value for whichever color you get 10 times its base value for the rest of that ball. &nbsp;Shooting the spinner increases the saucer value, but only for the color lit at the spinner at the time. &nbsp;The switches labeled &ldquo;change&rdquo; will flip which color the spinner advances. &nbsp; Ideally, you want to keep the spinner on the color you plunged and shoot it to advance it. &nbsp;Rebounds off of spinner shots, however, will often hit a change switch and flip it to the other color. &nbsp;If the spinner is on the wrong color, shoot the ball up the side of the machine to change it; it may take more than one try, depending on how many times you hit a change switch before you get the ball back under control on a flipper. &nbsp;Once your 10X side color bonus is at or near maximum value, shoot the saucer to collect. &nbsp;

feature is not currently on &ldquo;10X Bonus,&rdquo; shoot loop the loop to try to light it. &nbsp;In general, shooting up top from the left flipper is better than shooting the loop from the right, so if you have the option to transfer between flippers, get the ball on the left one unless it&rsquo;s time to shoot the left saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once your bonus is maxed at 100K and the 10X multiplier is lit, shoot the red drop targets for 100K each.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ignore the two standup targets on the center right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When the ball goes down either side outlane, try to bounce it up off the white mini posts back onto one of the rails leading to the flippers. &nbsp;This happens fairly often.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Air Aces [EM &ndash;

Such shots lead to side-to-side ball motion and risk draining out the sides. &nbsp;If you can&rsquo;t help it, or if the rebounds prove to be safe, fine, otherwise just use them for deflecting balls up to the top. &nbsp;Learn to gauge when it&rsquo;s safe to leave them down when the ball is falling down from above and let the ball roll to the lower flipper on the same side, or when to hold them up to deflect the ball so it lands on the opposite-side lower flipper. &nbsp;If it looks like the ball will do neither, then flip at it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Airport [EM &ndash;

the four-player version of it is College Queens (Airport is two-player). &nbsp;Shots at the vari-targets drain often enough to make them risky, though, so use caution. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re very precise and the flippers are strong enough to push the targets almost all the way back and if the 10 times value light is on - - all three of these - - then give it a go. &nbsp;Otherwise, avoid them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The game is later-ball-heavy due to when things light up. &nbsp;On each ball, more features &ndash; lanes and targets &ndash; will be lit for ten times starting value. &nbsp;This means a long ball 1 or 2 will be beaten by a ball 3, 4 or 5 of the same or even shorter length. &nbsp;Ball 5 in particular, with maximal lit values, is super important to have a long ball time; you can come from well behind at the end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The game has a side exit to the plunger lane right of the center bumper. &nbsp;Any time you see the ball in that area, try to nudge it out that lane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s no real strategy here, just flip the ball up into the bumpers and hope for lots of action and maybe a right-side exit. &nbsp;The other thing to do is shoot the ball up the left side lane, where it will exit into the bumpers at an angle. &nbsp;When the side lanes are lit for 300 points, that&rsquo;s your go-to shot;

the value increases to 1K after first shot and by 1K per shot thereafter until it reaches 5K. &nbsp;The key feed on this game is how the ball comes out of the horseshoe [how it comes down from the top B-C-D lanes and bumpers is pretty random]. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll usually be making the horseshoe clockwise [outside looping to inside], and it should come towards the left flipper, but if it tends to hit the left slingshot or go towards the center drain instead, use caution with this shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus maxes out at 15,000. &nbsp;[When bonus is over 10,000, one of the 1000 through 5000 lights will be on in addition to the 10,000 light.] &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ignore the &ldquo;300 plus advance bonus&rdquo;

Algar is lots of grinding and trying to survive random bounces.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">The Skill Shot is to make the top center saucer to open the gate at the far right outlane; the saucer also spots one letter in K-O-R-A. &nbsp;The Kora lanes at the top advance your bonus multiplier one notch each time you complete the set up to 5X. &nbsp;Bonus multipliers are held from ball to ball, so get them early if they&rsquo;re your goal.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">The captive balls work on a progressive basis: &nbsp;the first shot to one is 30K, and moves the ball to the back position, out of reach; the second shot, which must now hit one of the other two captive balls, is 40K, and pushes that ball out of reach; the third ball is 50K. &nbsp;Once all three have been hit, you must shoot the &ldquo;reset ball chamber&rdquo; at the upper left to drop the balls back into their original hittable positions. &nbsp;The reset chamber is active as soon as at least one captive ball has been hit, i.e. if the ball goes in there after just one captive ball hit, that one ball is released. &nbsp;The captive ball value, though, does not reset when balls are released; it stays raised up to 40K or 50K.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">The other strategy is to play UTAD, going for Kora letters and thus bonus multipliers, and getting base bonus advances along the way for each lane and drop target scored. &nbsp;Max bonus is the typical 29K and 5X for 145K.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">The narrow center lane feeds a path on the far left side which scores from 10K up to 60K max [I haven&rsquo;t discovered what raises the value]. &nbsp;If the ball enters from the bumper area, you get the base value, but if you get there by shooting through that center arc, you can get double value; you need to complete either of the drop target 3-banks to light the 2X shot arrow.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Finishing all 6 drop targets scores 10K the first time, rising 10K each completion up to 100K.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">The drains on this game are odd. &nbsp;That left arc-chute shot can drain if the ball comes through it down to the gate above the left flipper at the wrong speed and kicks the edge of the gate, bounces backwards, then drops into the outlane behind the gate. &nbsp;Balls rolling up or shatzed up the left flipper can hit the gate, causing it to wobble open, then rattle out the outlane behind it as well. &nbsp;You have not one but two outlanes and no return lane on the right side, with two staggered-position slingshots, one below each. &nbsp;On the somewhat similar playfield of Embryon, that closer-in channel is a return lane rather than an outlane.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;look out for balls exiting the top bumper area on the right side, they can go right into the first right outlane.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Ali [SS - Stern, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Shoot the upper left 3-bank for bonus X until at 5X, then shoot the right saucer all day for bonus collects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right initially, Left once shooting collect bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Shots to master: &nbsp;the right collect bonus saucer and the upper 3-bank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This game is largely about completing the upper left 3-bank to advance your bonus multiplier, which carries over from ball to ball(!), so it&rsquo;s important to raise it to the maximum of 5X a.s.a.p., on ball 1 if you can. &nbsp;The right side saucer is your bonus collect, which includes any multiplier. &nbsp;Most big games come from getting your bonus up to 5X early and then collecting it a lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are also good points to be had from the left side 3-bank once you have lots of letters in &ldquo;Greatest.&rdquo; &nbsp;Finishing this bank is worth the current star value of 4K-10K, plus one more star value for each &ldquo;Greatest&rdquo; letter; if you&rsquo;ve finished Greatest and have this at 10K, a completed bank is worth 90k, not too shabby even compared to the bonus collect saucer. &nbsp;That left 3-bank is even more worth shooting at if you find that hits to it rebound into the top multiplier bank, giving you at least two worthwhile drop targets for a single shot. &nbsp;A nice scraping-the-face shot can often get all three targets on the left, plus some of the top ones. &nbsp;The top 3-bank is somewhat backhandable, too, so if the saucer value is low and you have the ball cradled on the left, try a backhand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The top left horseshoe at 2K per spin is good if the spinner is juicy but watch out for fast shots to it looping out the drain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So, how good are you at the saucer shot and how is the return feed from it? &nbsp;If you can reliably nail it and somehow get the kickout feed back to the left flipper to repeat the shot, then once your bonus is high, you&rsquo;re going to crush it making sequential saucer shots. &nbsp;Even if you can&rsquo;t catch the kickout, any way you can consistently find that gets the feed to the left flipper will work - holding up the right flipper to a cradle to set up a post pass, holding up the right flipper for to tip the ball to the left flipper, or just letting it come out and dead bounce from right to left, whatever works.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for building up your bonus, your drop target shots and other shots will go over some star rollovers to advance bonus. &nbsp;Random hits during a long ball will build up your bonus without you having to deliberately try to do so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As an FYI, the top 3-bank is worth 20K per set once you&rsquo;re at 5X.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you have your bonus maxed but find it difficult to transfer, for whatever reason, shoot at the left 3-bank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tilt does not reset the carried-over bonus X.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;kickout from the right collect bonus saucer, return from the top horseshoe, and the feed from the left &ldquo;Greatest&rdquo; lane behind the target bank. &nbsp;Also be wary when the ball comes out of the top bumpers on the far right side, it often drains out the right outlane from there.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Alien Poker [SS - Williams, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Up Top to complete the King lanes 3 times so your multiplier is at 4X, then get the center drop targets IN ORDER right to left 10-J-Q-K-A. &nbsp;Repeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing the center target bank &ldquo;Royal Flushes&rdquo; for 400K is the top goal. &nbsp;The strategy is UTAD until you have completed three sets of King lanes; each set advances your royal flush multiplier by one to a max of 4X. &nbsp;You also get a king spotted for balls through the left return lane, so watch for that; if you&rsquo;re one king away and get a return lane, you don&rsquo;t need to one-time the ball back up top from the left if that&rsquo;s your 4X or you&rsquo;re willing to finish with wherever that puts you, you can take the center target shot instead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The maximum base royal flush value is 100K; the value you&rsquo;ll get for completing it goes up or down as you hit the card targets in or out of order. &nbsp;Hit them 10-J-Q-K-A and you get the 100K times your multiplier. &nbsp;Targets hit in order stay down, ones out of order pop back up, so for instance if you go 10-J-K, after the 10 shot only JQKA are standing, after the J shot only QKA, but after hitting the K out of sequence, the K comes back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Don&rsquo;t ignore your end of ball bonus! &nbsp;You can get up to 390K in bonus if you max out your base bonus at 78K [40K+20K+18K, see playfield lights] and your bonus multiplier at 5X. &nbsp;Base bonus builds 1K for any king lane, 3K for either side saucer shot. &nbsp;Bonus X builds by hitting a lit &ldquo;Joker&rdquo; standup target. &nbsp;The lower three Jokers are all easy shots, and the upper one will often be hit by balls bouncing around in the bumpers. &nbsp;Only one is lit at a time, though, so don&rsquo;t bother shooting at a Joker unless it&rsquo;s lit.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Alien Star [SS - Gottlieb, 1984]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;complete the right side A-L-I-E-N standup targets to light the left side lock. &nbsp;Shoot the lock, preferably when lit for 5X [shooting the spinner changes the lock saucer playfield multiplier]. &nbsp;During multiball, shoot the spinner immediately after a ball triggers the right return lane switch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Left until lock lit, then Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Shots to Master: &nbsp;Spinner, Lock, alley pass left to right, &ldquo;N&rdquo;

getting the ball through the lane and then directly through the spinner can be worth up to 50X base value per spin, i.e. 50,000 points instead of 1000. &nbsp;One precise maximal spinner shot can give you over a million points!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Alien letter progress towards lighting the lock, or having the lock lit, carries over from ball to ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The right return lane always lights the 10X spinner value timer, so whenever the ball goes through there, you want to shoot the spinner unless you&rsquo;re about to lock the ball. &nbsp;Shatzing from the left flipper to the right flipper can set you up for a spinner rip, too, if the shatz goes all the way up to trigger the lane switch but not so far than you get an inlane-outlane drain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The top lanes, once your rotating light is lit, give four awards, none of great value unless extra balls are on: &nbsp;hold bonus, collect bonus, advance bonus X and extra ball. &nbsp;Each completion of Alien adds another award to the rotation. &nbsp;Shots through the right spinner above the Alien targets also advance your bonus X. &nbsp;But since your maximum bonus is 5X and 29K, both the right spinner and those top lane awards pale in comparison to even a good single-ball lit spinner shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you have the ball cradled on the right flipper without the lock lit, use a post pass or alley pass to transfer to the left, then shoot an Alien letter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you&rsquo;re playing last and just need a few hundred thousand to win, get the ball to the left flipper, shatz it up the right return lane, then shoot the spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The &ldquo;N&rdquo;

you may need to nudge the machine to avoid having it clip the top of the left slingshot and rattle into the left outlane. &nbsp;This can be the most important aspect of the game - - getting control of the ball ejected from the saucer when starting multiball. &nbsp;Do so and you have a good chance to set up and collect a 20K, 30K or 50K per-spin shot;

the top side lanes each score only 1K, one bonus advance and light one bumper. &nbsp;On your first shot with the left flipper, shoot the upper right lane arc to light the spinner. &nbsp;On your first shot with the right flipper, shoot through the left orbit spinner to open the gate at the lower right outlane. &nbsp;Whenever the ball is up top, you want it to drop into the center saucer rather than go through either side lane. &nbsp;But note that it can rim out of the center saucer and not score it, while passing through the side lanes is guaranteed to score those.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On your next shot with either flipper, shoot the center target to raise the post. &nbsp;You have now protected yourself from both center drains and right side drains until you trip a &ldquo;down post&rdquo; switch [center] or actually use the outlane gate on the right (gate closes once used). &nbsp;All shots with the right flipper should now be at the spinner. &nbsp;Once the spinner is lit and the post is up, if the ball is on the left flipper, transfer it to the right flipper if able to do so safely, otherwise reshoot the right lane arc at the top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feed is out of the right side arc lanes: &nbsp;the ball should lightly bounce off the rubber on the post at the bottom of the gate and fall to the right flipper. &nbsp;If it tends to fall to the left one, let it dead-bounce back to the right flipper; whichever it does, you want the ball back on the right flipper to shoot the spinner. &nbsp;If it tends to drain, find the timing for a nudge when it reaches that exit post to prevent this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Fine print on center &ldquo;up post&rdquo; target: &nbsp;when you hit it, the ball will rebound off of both it and whichever of the posts to its side the ball contacts. &nbsp;Watch out for side drains! &nbsp;If this shot turns out to be drainy on your Amigo, ignore it and just stick with the spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Fine print on &ldquo;down post&rdquo; buttons: &nbsp;accurate shots to the right lane arc [light spinner] and left orbit [spinner] will miss these buttons to the inside. &nbsp;Your greatest risk of the post dropping is when the ball falls out of the bumpers, and perhaps when it comes out of the right arc lanes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On some Amigos, you can get the balls going through the top right lane to bounce off of the top right bumper into the u-turn chute. &nbsp;If this works a high percentage of the time, one strategy for the game is to shoot the spinner up top, nudge the ball into the right lane, nudge it off the right bumper into the chute, catch or dead bounce the ball exiting the chute to the right flipper, repeat.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Andromeda [SS &ndash;

shoot the ball into the scoop above and behind it to lock the ball; shoot the launch ball stand-up target on the left below there to start multiball. &nbsp;The launch ball target is deceptively hard to hit, being somewhat guarded by the corner above the lower bumper. &nbsp;Two catches of note: &nbsp;first, unlike most machines, balls can go through the lock slot to the top without triggering the lock; second, there&rsquo;s lock stealing here, the machine doesn&rsquo;t care who locked the ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s a playfield multiplier of 2X during multiball. &nbsp;Best strategy is to shoot the balls to the top through the spinner. &nbsp;Completing the six red drop targets scores 50K and advances the spinner value from 1K to 3K. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll inevitably get some drop targets without trying to, so just let them happen and only shoot at them if you&rsquo;re down to just one or two left. &nbsp;Focus on the spinner. &nbsp;Completing the drops a second time is another 50K and raises the spinner value to 4K. &nbsp;Repeatedly playing multiball is the strategy on this game, though if you&rsquo;re playing last and need a moderate amount of quick points, a high-value spinner shot or two is good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus goes up to 80K, multiplier up to 10X. &nbsp;Completing the top 3 lanes advances the bonus X; it goes 2X, 3X, 4X, 5X, then suddenly to 10X, so that last set is very valuable. &nbsp;Drop targets and lanes all advance bonus, so don&rsquo;t actively shoot to increase it, just let it happen when you can&rsquo;t make other shots.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lanes on the right side are okay value, 20K and 3 bonus advances each.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You may want to hold up the left flipper while the ball is rattling around the left bumper to guard against center drains.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s a hidden divider under the plastic behind the drop targets. &nbsp;The ball can come out the center of the drop bank or go to the right lane;

Williams, 1977]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD. &nbsp;Once your base bonus is maxed at 100,000, shoot the drop target bank to light the right side saucer for double donus (first completion) and then extra ball (second completion). &nbsp;Resume UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Shot to master: &nbsp;Spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Desperation Nudge: &nbsp;almost never a good idea</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;make the top center lane to open the gate [lower left outlane].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In general, your shots should be to the spinner from the left flipper and to the upper left advance bonus rollover disc from the right flipper until your bonus base is maxed out at 100,000. &nbsp;Both of these shots provide both points and an opportunity to get the ball into the top center &ldquo;open gate&rdquo; lane. &nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t make the Skill Shot, or if at any time the gate is not open (it closes once used), you can also try a not-too-hard shatz of the left return lane to open the gate. &nbsp;I say &ldquo;not too hard&rdquo; on shatzing because a strong shot will open the gate, roll up the left outlane, trigger the gate to close, and the ball will then drain out that outlane. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The spinner on this game can make or break you, and is the most important shot to master. &nbsp;The spinner lights and unlights on 10-point switch hits, i.e. the slingshots. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s worth 100 unlit, 1000 when lit; a nicely &ldquo;juiced&rdquo; lit spinner can reward you with 40,000 points for a good shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once the bonus is maxed at 100K, you want to give yourself a chance to get the double bonus. &nbsp;Completing the drop target 4-bank once lights the right saucer for double bonus. &nbsp;A direct shot at the saucer rarely works - - it&rsquo;s too hard and will be often be rejected; you can try it a few times if you like to see if your Argosy is less rejection-prone, but if it&rsquo;s like most, you&rsquo;re better off just shooting up top through the spinner, lit or not. &nbsp;You can often &ldquo;luck&rdquo; into double bonus via a kick from the left slingshot; observe where kicks from that slingshot go, then try nudging the ball when it hits that sling at a good speed and angle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With your bonus doubled, you could try to light the saucer to enable scoring an extra ball if they are enabled (if not, UTAD from the right flipper, either at that upper button or via transfer to the left flipper to shoot a lit spinner). &nbsp;Lighting the Extra Ball enabler at the right side saucer is done by completing the 4 drop targets a second time. &nbsp;Like double bonus, collecting it is more likely to be from a slingshot kick than a direct shot to the saucer. &nbsp;Even after you get the ball in the lit saucer, though, you don&rsquo;t actually collect an extra ball unless the ball drains through the EB-lit outlane. &nbsp;In practice, between having to both get the ball in the saucer and drain through the lit outlane, both of which are more luck than skill here, I wouldn&rsquo;t bother to actively try for it even if EBs are on, just continue UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When your base bonus is maxxed out at 100,000, the value of the top center lane rises to 10,000, so it&rsquo;s still very much worth nudging the ball into that lane whenever you can. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s worth 11,000 when unlit (lane value plus bonus added), 10,000 when lit!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Due to the high portion of your score that will come from end-of-ball bonus, desperation saves are almost never worth the risk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;the &ldquo;dribble down&rdquo;

this was Chicago Coin&rsquo;s way of turning an outlane into a return lane, saving space vs. having one of each. &nbsp;If the ball doesn&rsquo;t hit both open gate targets before coming down to the flippers, you should try to open those gates rather than working on your rocket values, but don&rsquo;t shoot at the lower standups to do that! &nbsp;Shoot the ball up top to the bumpers to hope that you hit the upper standups. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Notice that huge center drain area with a not-too-useful center post (which might not even be there; I&rsquo;ve seen this both with and without the center post). &nbsp;Shots at the lower open-gate targets risk center drains way too much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you&rsquo;re accurate enough, make your shots to the top through the rocket lanes; if not, go up the sides towards the upper stand-ups. &nbsp;An ideal side shot to the top will probably just miss the inside of either advance rocket rollover button; don&rsquo;t worry about missing the button, the ball will likely go over it on the way back down. &nbsp;Button shots can hit the posts to the inside of the lower stand-up targets and bounce dangerously out of control.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The small white rollover buttons raise the rocket value in stages (what else?) from 50 points to a maximum of 500.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s no bonus, and tilt ends just the ball in play, not the whole game, so feel free to shake hard to save if necessary.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Atlantis [EM - Gottlieb, 1975]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c9">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Shoot the drop targets on the left </span><span class="c17 c5 c9">in pairs</span><span class="c3">. &nbsp;If you can nudge the ball into a lit number lane, do so, but shooting the right-side waterfall lanes for the numbers is optional.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;plunge the lit yellow lane. &nbsp;The lane changes with top slingshot hits, so allow for and count your bounces!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The right flipper has up-and-outlane risk. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t make the mistake of holding the right flipper up when the ball is coming fast towards it and having the ball roll up and out the right side. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hit drop targets in pairs [5000 vs. 500], shoot lit yellow lanes when handy [3000 vs. 500] and targets [3000 vs. 500].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The 1-9 sequence is not worth special effort;

nudge so it either goes in the 2 or 3 return lanes or comes out into the middle of the playfield towards a flipper. &nbsp;Beware of the &ldquo;slow dribbler&rdquo; out the bottom of the 6 or 9, which often bounces low post to &ndash; &nbsp;top outside of slingshot to &ndash; outlane. &nbsp;The other two key feeds are how the ball is kicked out of the saucers; shoot each saucer early to find out.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Bank-A-Ball [EM - Gottlieb, 1965]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Bank-A-Ball is not designed for tournament play, instead being geared specifically towards winning free games. &nbsp;I include it here for reference only.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;make either &ldquo;lights bumper&rdquo;

completing 1-2-3, changed with the right flipper, increases the lower saucer value to 30K, 60K then 90K, while completing 4-5-6, changed with the left flipper, increases the bullseye shot value to 20K, 40K or EB [may be 100K]. &nbsp;The saucer value resets when scored, but not the target value, so the 4-5-6 is the more useful of the two. &nbsp;Both reset each ball. &nbsp;But a ball going through a top lane will score the lowest unscored value, so if you want a 4, 5 or 6, you must get the ball through a lane where you have already collected the 1, 2 or 3 on that cycle. &nbsp;If you work it right, you can score the 4-5-6 with just 4 lanes, by moving which of the 1-2-3 you already have. &nbsp;Completing all six numbers lights the upper saucer for collect bonus, which resets your base bonus when collected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center standup targets increase the base value [left] and multiplier [right] for the target bonus in the horseshoe. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t bother shooting them intentionally, though, let it happen on its own. &nbsp;If you happen to have the value up high [it maxes out at 10X/25K or 250,000 points], go ahead and take it, otherwise ignore it. &nbsp;It resets when collected unless your multiplier and base value are on the same tier, e.g. 19K and 3X or 25K and 10X, in which case both the base and the multiplier are preserved. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s possible to get it up to 250K, where it will stay until collected twice or until the end of the ball. &nbsp;Odds are, though, that you&rsquo;ll collect it accidentally and ruin your chances of getting that far when the ball is bouncing around the bumpers, so don&rsquo;t focus on it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The locks and multiballs on this game are unique. &nbsp;A ball locked in the upper saucer acts as a ball save unless you start a 3-ball multiball: &nbsp;if you drain before starting multiball, the ball is kicked back into play [and you must re-earn lighting the lock]. &nbsp;A ball locked in the lower saucer will start a 2-ball multiball if there&rsquo;s no ball in the top one and start a 3-ball multiball if there is.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Baseball [EM - Gottlieb, 1970]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD or vari-targets all day, the latter only with strong flippers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;any of the top 3-1-2 lanes; the points are the same for each. &nbsp;If you find that one of the lanes feeds the ball into one of the bumpers better than the others, stick with that lane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are two ways to play the game: &nbsp;UTAD and vari-target. &nbsp;The vari-targets score 500 when pushed all the way back; how often your shot gets full or near-full value will depend on how recently the flippers were rebuilt, how steep the game is, and how accurate you are. &nbsp;If your percentage on the vari-target is good, go that route. &nbsp;If not, try UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Interesting rules for the pop bumpers. &nbsp;They light together, never separately, and they light only when you have runners on both second and third base. &nbsp;How do you do this? &nbsp;Those 3-1-2 lanes at the top each place a runner on the corresponding base when triggered. &nbsp;The 3 [left], 2 [two, upper center] and 1 [right] standup targets likewise place a runner on the corresponding base. &nbsp;Each lane and the #2 targets score 50; the 1 and 3 standups score 100, so scoring #2 and #3 via either lane or target will do it. &nbsp;But that&rsquo;s not all. &nbsp;The vari-targets, besides scoring points, score hits - - singles for weak hits, doubles and triples for stronger ones, a home run for a maximum 500 point hit. &nbsp;The right combination of hits will get you the necessary runners. &nbsp;Also, if you have a runner on first base, with or without runners on second or third, and score a double via the left side 200-point lane, you&rsquo;ll then have runners on 2</span><span class="c5 c23">nd</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;and 3</span><span class="c5 c23">rd</span><span class="c5">. &nbsp;It may be the most creative ways to toggle the bumpers of any pinball machine ever built - - not on switch hits, not on scoring reel status, not when you hit a specific target or set thereof and not when you finish all the lanes or numbers. &nbsp;You can light them with as few as two shots, even using just the vari-targets [single, then double], or never light them for the entire game even with a high score. &nbsp;And they turn off only </span><span class="c5 c9">sometimes</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;when you hit something in the game: &nbsp;runners on 2</span><span class="c5 c23">nd</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;and 3</span><span class="c5 c23">rd</span><span class="c5">, get a double, they turn off; runners on 1</span><span class="c5 c23">st</span><span class="c5">, 2</span><span class="c5 c23">nd</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;and 3</span><span class="c5 c23">rd</span><span class="c2">, get a double, then stay on. &nbsp;But scoring a triple will always turn the bumpers off. &nbsp;Ingenious. &nbsp;[My thanks to Jim Swain of Pintastic who took the glass off and helped me figure all this out.]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anyway, if you have the bumpers lit, UTAD becomes a more viable strategy, since it doesn&rsquo;t take that many bumper hits to match the value of a vari-target shot. &nbsp;Whether or not you should try to light them, e.g. by shooting at the standup targets, is another matter. &nbsp;So even if you&rsquo;ve selected the vari-target strategy over UTAD, if you do get the bumpers lit, go UTAD while they are.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;out of the side double and triple lanes; watch out for both side and center drains. &nbsp;Side drains are worth 500 points, a big number on this machine, and you might actually win a game by &ldquo;draining correctly&rdquo; often enough. &nbsp;The feed from the top bumpers to the center is safer than it looks. &nbsp;Most of the time, the ball will hit the side of the vari-target chamber and deflect towards one of the flippers or the bottom of the slingshots / return lane wires above them.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Beat the Clock [SS &ndash; Bally, 1985]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;Hit the STOP targets to stop the clock, then right orbit to advance bonus multiplier and add bonus, then shoot collect bonus saucer top left. &nbsp;If out of time with little bonus, go for the standup targets behind the drop targets on the left to add time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to Flipper: &nbsp;Left initially, Right later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Shots to master: &nbsp;right orbit, collect bonus saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One of the few games that runs on time, not ball count. &nbsp;For a good score, you have to not just shoot for points but also stop the clock and add more playing time to your game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To stop the clock, shoot the four standup S-T-O-P targets at the upper right. &nbsp;The clock restarts whenever the ball goes over either green star rollover button. &nbsp;The clock is also turned off when the ball drains and doesn&rsquo;t restart until you plunge and hit a switch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Scoring the top saucer adds 10 time units when flashing. &nbsp;Making a right orbit shot lights it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The way to add the most time is to complete the left T-I-M-E-R standup target bank hidden behind the left drop target bank. &nbsp;First, you need to shoot all the drop targets to expose the standup targets, then complete the standups. &nbsp;That adds 25 time units, then the drop targets pop back up. &nbsp;The drop bank scores 50K, 100K and then 150K the third time; you can get another 25 seconds each time you complete the standup bank. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll find that trying to hit the lowermost target or two on the left from the bottom flipper tends to go over the start clock rollover. &nbsp;Get those from the upper flipper instead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus goes up to 395K base: &nbsp;200K + 100K + 50K + 45K; bonus multiplier goes up to 5X, so you can build up almost 2 million in bonus. &nbsp;Advance bonus X via the right orbit shot after knocking down the single drop target protecting it. &nbsp;Base bonus is earned in 5K increments by scoring the top ABCD lanes and any target. &nbsp;Bonus is NOT collected when the ball drains (otherwise you could just keep draining a big bonus). &nbsp;You only collect bonus through that top left saucer. &nbsp;Base bonus value is held when balls drain but any multiplier is lost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing A-B-C-D starts 2X scoring; doing it a second time while 2X is running starts 3X scoring. &nbsp;Playfield multiplier does not apply to collect bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The game ends when the ball drains with no time units remaining. &nbsp;When the ball is in play and your time units run down to zero, you keep playing until the ball drains. &nbsp;You can also rebuild time units back from zero to get more play / more balls. &nbsp;Tilt penalty is end of ball in play plus loss of 15 time units. &nbsp;That means game over if you have 15 or fewer units left when you tilt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Note the reversed return lane / outlane setup on the left side. &nbsp;One strategic thing to try is when the ball goes out the left outlane, it stops the clock. &nbsp;You still have a slim chance of nudging the ball off the edge of the left return lane curve so that the ball deflects through the gate above the left flipper and back into play. &nbsp;If you can pull that off, you&rsquo;ll have both saved your ball and stopped the clock!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The way to big points on this game is to build your bonus and multiplier with right orbit shots, then shoot the Collect Bonus saucer at the far upper left. &nbsp;That both scores your bonus and adds 5 time units.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Big Ben [EM - Williams, 1975]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Up top until your base bonus is at maximum, then shoot the B-E-N oversized drop targets to double it. &nbsp;At that point, resume UTAD from the right flipper and choose to either shoot the right hand saucer for 5,000 from the left flipper or go UTAD with it as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Mild bias Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This was one of the first tournament games I ever played [at the New York State championships in 1975, where first prize was a brand new Bally Wizard]. &nbsp;Big Ben didn&rsquo;t really have much to offer in terms of strategy, but I include it for historical purposes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;get a letter in B-I-G at the top that you lack. &nbsp;Note that there&rsquo;s an open gap left of the top lanes, so a too-casual plunge won&rsquo;t get any letter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The only decent points on the game are your bonus, the right saucer when lit and the three 1000-point rollovers on the left. &nbsp;Going up top right away with both flippers will let you advance your bonus; each B-I-G lane gives one advance. &nbsp;Completing the three of them lights the saucer on the right for 5,000. &nbsp;Your first order of business is to just keep pounding the top shot until both of these are accomplished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At that point, you can double your bonus by completing the three B-E-N drop targets. &nbsp;These involve more risk of draining on the rebound, though, so if you notice them doing so, ignore them and continue UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once the right hand saucer is lit for 5k, that&rsquo;s your highest-value shot, so take it when you can if you&rsquo;re accurate enough and the kickout from the saucer is safe. &nbsp;Watch out if the special is turned on but does not award points: &nbsp;completing B-I-G a second time changes the saucer value to special, making it totally worthless in that case.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Big Brave [EM - Gottlieb, 1974]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD &ndash;

if you miss, the rebound is likely to drain. &nbsp;UTAD also gives you the chance to complete all three top lanes for double bonus.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Big Deal [EM - Williams, 1977]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD [left side only].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Big Deal&rdquo;

for scoring on this game is the Aces. &nbsp;There are four Ace lanes at the top, and four more below, the two return lanes and the two outanes. &nbsp;Each Ace lane adds 10K to your bonus. &nbsp;Getting all four Aces doubles your bonus. &nbsp;You also advance your bonus with each of the three red standup targets [left side of lower playfield;

if EBs are on, you still shouldn&rsquo;t bother hitting the letters until your bonus is maxed out at 200K.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Big Flipper [EM &ndash; Chicago Coin, 1970]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bigger is not always better. &nbsp;In this case, bigger is about as bad as it gets. &nbsp;The oversized flippers make shooting far less accurate and narrow in range than normal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Score-wise, it&rsquo;s all about building up the bonus score with the A-B-C top lanes and the two side standup targets, and also getting the ball to drop in the center saucer to collect it. &nbsp;Bonus value collected at the saucer stays at the current value. &nbsp;When the bonus is at 500 and you get another bonus advance, you score 100 for the lane or target plus 1000 points for rolling over the bonus value, which then resets to zero. &nbsp;Bonus saucer value is preserved from ball to ball AND from game to game, making it a bad tournament choice - - if you start a game with the 500 lit, your first top lane advance scores 1100 total, while if you start with it at zero, you just score 100.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Drain down either side to collect the current bonus score; center drains score nothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Clearly marked rollover buttons on the lower playfield control the ball saver post between the flippers. &nbsp;Use the center post when it&rsquo;s up. &nbsp;Most shots on the flipper are fairly late, i.e. close to the tip. &nbsp;Probably the lamest game I&rsquo;ve ever played.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Big Game [SS - Stern, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Spinners whenever lit [the far left one is best], otherwise drop targets all day. &nbsp;If you have the ball cradled on the right flipper, it&rsquo;s also fine to shoot the outer spinner to get the ball to the top saucer even if the spinner isn&rsquo;t lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Shot to master: &nbsp;far left spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Big Game is mostly about spinners with a dose of drop targets and lanes. &nbsp;The right and interior left spinners are worth 1000 when lit. &nbsp;They light whenever you have the &ldquo;X&rdquo; grid lighted. &nbsp;Which grid among X, Y and Z is active cycles with several things: &nbsp;switch hits to the slingshots, top bumper and center star rollover; balls through any of the top B-I-G lanes. &nbsp;The far left spinner is worth 2000 when lit but has the added benefit of feeding balls to the upper saucer and then to the top three lanes. &nbsp;The saucer awards 5000 per letter collected so far in B-I-G G-A-M-E, plus 35,000 extra if you&rsquo;ve already completed the Big Game letters once.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus from the drop targets is complicated. &nbsp;You get 1000 per number in each grid, or 27K basic bonus. &nbsp;You get double value if you&rsquo;ve either completed a card or have a line of three on each card. &nbsp;You get triple value for two completed cards or two lines of three on each card. &nbsp;Got that? &nbsp;Oh, and once you&rsquo;ve finished all three cards, you get the &ldquo;reserve bonus&rdquo; lit, which is a 27000 super bonus that holds to subsequent balls. &nbsp;You also get 5K when you complete a line of three in any grid with &ldquo;extra score&rdquo; lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Now, some ball control thoughts. &nbsp;Backhanding the interior left spinner is usually both possible and preferable to shooting it from the right flipper. &nbsp;Besides post passes using the upper flippers, you can often do a pseudo-post pass from the lower flippers as well, bouncing the ball off the underside of the top flipper rather than a post. &nbsp;And dead bounces are extremely useful, since you have two flippers on the opposite side of the game for the ball to cross over and land on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for the far left spinner, it might only be possible from one of the two right-hand flippers; if the lower one is strong enough, I prefer that, but sometimes the upper flipper gets in the way of the shot when the ball is cradled on the bottom. &nbsp;Bottom shots work best when the ball is rolling down the lower flipper. &nbsp;Top flipper shots, when they work, are extremely late, right by the tip of the flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;balls coming out of the upper right chute and the center-left chute. &nbsp;Watch out for center drains if the ball speed is &ldquo;wrong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Side drains are very common since balls heading for the sides are usually at an oblique angle, letting them zip right past both the slingshot top and the side post. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re only likely to save balls to the side if they head that way horizontally or almost perfectly vertically.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At least on Big Game you can&rsquo;t lose a ball with a &ldquo;scissors&rdquo; flub [between the paired flippers, like on Paragon, Captain Fantastic or Harlem Globetrotters], although you can lose it by a ball hitting the lower flipper of the pair, then the underside of the upper flipper, then hopping over the lower flipper.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Big Hit [EM &ndash; Gottlieb, 1977]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;UTAD. &nbsp;Only shoot the vari-targets if the rebounds from them drop nicely to a flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Not much to do here. &nbsp;Shoot the drop targets up top and try to make the two top corner horseshoe shots for 5000 points when the ball is aligned for it; note you can&rsquo;t cradle on the upper flippers. &nbsp;The vari-targets give good points, but can drop the ball onto the bumpers, from which it goes who knows where. &nbsp;Avoid the vari-targets if they feed the bumpers. &nbsp;The bumpers are worth 1000, so when the ball comes down either side &ldquo;double&rdquo; or &ldquo;triple&rdquo; lane, try to get as much bumper action as you can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ordinarily, runs are not counted for competition, so I&rsquo;ve ignored them. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re in an event where they do count, make extra effort to score a Home Run with a horseshoe or vari-target shot whenever you have two or more men on base.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is one of the few games with a center-mounted autoplunger: &nbsp;the ball is ejected from the outhole between the flippers at the beginning of each ball. &nbsp;Watch out for a bad autoplunge; I&rsquo;ve seen games where the plunges go up, hit one thing or two weakly, then drain.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Big Indian [EM - Gottlieb, 1974]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD &ndash;

if you miss, the rebound is likely to drain. &nbsp;UTAD also gives you the chance to complete all three top lanes for double bonus.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Big Shot [EM - Gottlieb, 1973]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Get all 15 pool balls, then UTAD, trying to get the 8-ball lane for 5,000 or as many other top lanes and bumper hits as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the 2-player version of Hot Shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One of several pool-themed games where your goal is to collect all 15 pool balls. &nbsp;On this game, 14 of these are in two rows of seven standup targets on each side. &nbsp;The last is the eight ball, earned from either the top center lane [your Skill Shot] or the center saucer [risky shot]. &nbsp;The eight ball shot also opens the ball return gate on the lower right side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is 1000 per pool ball, 15k max; the bonus is doubled on the second-last ball (ball 4 in tournament play) and tripled on the last ball (ball 5). &nbsp;The game is therefore highly skewed towards the last two balls since bonus is a large part of your overall score.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One drawback of this game is that once you&rsquo;ve collected all of the pool balls, there&rsquo;s not much to do - - the targets don&rsquo;t reset in the replay version like they do in the add-a-ball one, and there&rsquo;s no collect bonus feature. &nbsp;About all that&rsquo;s left is are the lanes for 500 or 1000 each and the bumper for 1000 at that stage.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Big Show [EM &ndash;

standups are risky shots, I prefer UTAD to advance bonus [and to light the disks if I missed them on the plunge].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is doubled on balls 3 and 5; you can&rsquo;t double it on the other balls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Like some games, this has an extra ball feature that is on a bonus value cycle: &nbsp;it lights only when the bonus is at exactly 15000. &nbsp;Take it if you can, but it&rsquo;s usually turned off for competition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since you&rsquo;ll be going UTAD, the key feeds will be how the ball comes down each side orbit - - you may need to bump the game when the ball gets to the post below the lowest white disk - - and how the ball comes down through the center gap below the bumper. &nbsp;Most of the time it comes down the center gap, it will have traveled along the angled rubber in that section and won&rsquo;t drain down the middle, but you still may need to nudge to get the ball to come to a flipper rather than hit one of the lower slingshots or drain out the side.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Big Star [EM - Williams 1972]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;shoot the red rollover buttons to advance the value of the center saucer, hit the drop target in front of it to expose it, shoot the saucer. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the add-a-ball version of Super Star, with different point values.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Not a game I&rsquo;m thrilled about. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s got multiple ball protect features that are moderately useful, but not much to shoot at. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s start with the protectors: &nbsp;the upper left yellow standup raises the rubber post at the left outlane, the upper right target does it at the right outlane. &nbsp;Both posts can have the ball creep past them, but they will save at least half the balls heading their way. &nbsp;The posts are lowered if you hit the middle standup target on the same side of the machine, or if you make the center saucer shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The two lower outside slingshots raise the center post, but the button right above that post lowers it, so again it&rsquo;s only partial protection - - a ball heading SDTM can go over that button, lower the post, and drain. &nbsp;On the other hand, some balls heading towards a center drain will deflect off the edge of the down post button enough for you to save them with a flipper. &nbsp;You can have some long game times if you keep the three posts up and the tilt is liberal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for points, see the quickie version: &nbsp;shoot the red rollovers to raise the saucer value, hit the drop target in front of it, shoot the saucer. &nbsp;A well-aimed shot will score all five rollovers on a side in sequence; each advance through number five moves the value of the center saucer up by 10000 points. &nbsp;Bumpers, standup targets and slingshots, all are worth diddly squat [10 or 100] compared to the 10000 to 40000 for the center saucer. &nbsp;The &ldquo;advance&rdquo; standup targets to the sides of the center saucer each advance you a couple of 1-2-3-4-5 numbers towards raising the saucer value (how many is setting-adjustable).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Extra balls and specials may be set to award 100,000 points instead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The top three SU-P-ER lane at least give you 5000 when you get all three of them. &nbsp;Yawn.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Black Hole [SS &ndash; Gottlieb, 1981]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;Not really. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s part of why this game is so challenging.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to Flipper: &nbsp;Mild bias Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The first game with both an underneath playfield and backwards flippers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Scoring well on Black Hole is a multi-step process. &nbsp;One of the first things you want to do involves some luck or bravery: &nbsp;opening the re-entry gate. &nbsp;Doing so on the main playfield requires completing the four standup targets at the lower right, then getting the ball to roll through the lane below them - - that&rsquo;s the luck part. &nbsp;Opening this gate means that after you play on the lower playfield, the ball will be returned for play on the main playfield; if the gate&rsquo;s not open, the ball will drain. &nbsp;You can also risk shooting the ball to the lower playfield without the gate open, but you then need to open the gate by completing either target bank there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Either completing the main playfield target bank, which also lights the main level captive ball hole, or shooting the ball to the lower level sets up phase two - - locking balls. &nbsp;The lower level capture lock, on the left side, is always active. &nbsp;Lock one ball there and the other on the main level above the upper left flipper. &nbsp;A ball locked in the lower playfield stays there at the end of a ball and can be stolen by other players. &nbsp;Balls in the upper lock are released to the outlane at the end of each player&rsquo;s ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Multiball is complicated: &nbsp;once two balls are locked, you plunge a third ball. If you shoot that down to the lower level, the lower locked ball is released and you start a two-ball multiball below. &nbsp;If your gate is open, it will stay open during multiball. &nbsp;When both lower balls drain from the lower level, the upper locked ball kicks out, and the two lower balls reenter the main level through the open gate for three-ball multiball. &nbsp;Try to send the balls back to the lower level for more bonus while the gate is open.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing either upper drop target bank gives you a playfield multiplier on the lower playfield: &nbsp;one bank for 2X, both banks for 3X. &nbsp;Your ideal situation is to already have this ready, or be close, when you start multiball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is scored only on the lower playfield. &nbsp;Bonus multiplier is advanced by completing either the top three lanes or the &ldquo;rollunder&rdquo; on the lower playfield (player&rsquo;s right, between the targets and the bumper, shot towards you).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy tip: &nbsp;when the ball exits the lower playfield with the gate open, immediately shoot it back down there from the right flipper; the gate will stay open until you hit a switch on the main playfield. &nbsp;Repeat as many times as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball control warnings: &nbsp;trying to cradle up can lead to draining on either side. &nbsp;On the left, balls can roll up the rail above the lower left flipper and dribble out through the gap in the corner. &nbsp;On the right, balls deflected towards the gate from the top double flipper can push through the gate, which then closes behind the ball, and the ball drains out the right. &nbsp;Use drop catches with either flipper or dead bounces off the left flipper but not the right flippers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Black Knight [SS - Williams, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD from the bottom and Multiball all day up top; lock the balls up top via the mini-orbit shot with the upper left flipper. &nbsp;You may need to complete the top drop target bank to light lock.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right on the bottom, balanced on top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Shots to master: &nbsp;left orbit to upper playfield; upper orbit lock.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once popular in tournaments and leagues, Black Knight has fallen out of favor for being too easy when in normal condition. &nbsp;You hold the upper right flipper up on the moderate-strength plunge to deflect the ball over to the left, then shoot it around the upper orbit into the lock trough above the upper left flipper. &nbsp;Continue to do this until three balls are locked, then play multiball, where you get 3X playfield scoring while you still have all three balls alive and 2X scoring once down to two balls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Multiball is also available by shooting the green-arrow-lit shot in the center of the lower playfield once you have at least one ball locked up top. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s the only way to play a two-ball multiball, i.e. lock one ball, then shoot that. &nbsp;If you have two balls locked and shoot it, you get a three-ball multiball. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s better to start multiball up top, though, since that way all three balls are ejected to the upper playfield, making it easier to keep all three of them in play longer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In multiball, you don&rsquo;t really aim so much as just try to keep as many balls in play as possible. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll hit lots of targets, orbits and loops just doing that. &nbsp;Your score is more a function of how long you keep multiball going rather than what specific things you hit during it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The half-figure-eight shot partially hidden to the right of the left orbit / ramp is your bonus multiplier advance shot. &nbsp;It can be drainy, so I generally don&rsquo;t shoot for intentionally, rather I &ldquo;let it happen&rdquo; during multiball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing target banks lights one of the &ldquo;magna saves.&rdquo; &nbsp;These are mostly-reliable ball saves triggered manually, not automatically, by hitting one of the extra set of buttons next to the flipper buttons. &nbsp;The magna saves [try to] grab the ball, hold it for a few seconds, then [usually] drop it into the return lane below.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus goes up to 49K and 5X for 245K maximum total.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lastly, the return lanes: &nbsp;the left one lights the center ramp briefly for a &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; award shot value of between 20K and 99K. &nbsp;The right return lane lights the spinner briefly for 2500 per spin. &nbsp;These two shots are the best ones to take from the lower flippers during multiball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;ve seen Black Knight set so that to light each lock, you have to complete the upper drop target three-bank before the timer it&rsquo;s on runs out and resets the targets. &nbsp;Set that way, the game works well in competition, since now it&rsquo;s not so trivial to start multiball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One other strategy I&rsquo;ve seen is to keep hammering the top left target bank all day. &nbsp;If you can keep the ball up top long enough doing this, it&rsquo;s a viable scoring alternative.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Don&rsquo;t bother shooting at things on the main [lower] playfield, just go UTAD from the bottom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feed: &nbsp;where do balls through the half-figure-eight go, drain or safe?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key shot selection item: &nbsp;is the right flipper strong enough to shoot the ball up the left ramp? &nbsp;If not, find a way to transfer to the right and go up top via the right or center ramp.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Black Pyramid [SS - Bally, 1984]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Orbits all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Left until you have 5X, then balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Shots to master: &nbsp;both orbits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;plunge to get the &ldquo;A&rdquo; in Black and open your gate at the lower right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The right orbit inline drops give you 2X, 3X, 5X, then allow the ball to go up top, scoring a letter in the process.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is yet another game with a Super Bonus feature: &nbsp;completing &ldquo;Black Pyramid&rdquo; the first time gives you the 60K held bonus, a second time gives 120K, so your maximum bonus is 120K + 11*5K [11 more letters in Black Pyramid a third time; competing it resets] times max multiplier of 5X for a total of 875,000!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shooting the orbits give decent points, too. &nbsp;The left one starts at 20K and goes up from there each time you shoot it, eventually getting to EB after 70K, then resetting to 20K after the EB is scored. &nbsp;You also get a letter in Black if you still need any; if you have Black completed, you get a number in &ldquo;200000&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The right one is worth either a &ldquo;Pyramid&rdquo; letter, a &ldquo;Black&rdquo; letter or 50K per shot once you&rsquo;ve completed the three bonus X drop targets in front of the red star rollover.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The swinging target is best avoided, but here&rsquo;s what you get for it: &nbsp;each hit lights either a number in &ldquo;200000&rdquo; or one of the two stars on the end, whichever is lit when the ball hits the target. &nbsp;Completing the six lights in &ldquo;200000&rdquo; scores that value, but if you have completed one star first, it&rsquo;s double that, and two stars first, triple that for 600K. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a high risk of drain shot, though, so most players avoid it even with the points to be had there and just do orbits all day. &nbsp;But &hellip; if you have collected five of the 200000 numbers via shooting the left orbit and happened to hit a couple of stars along the way by accident, it&rsquo;s sure worth one shot at that last number to get your 600K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball control: &nbsp;the ball rarely enters the return lanes fast enough to not be able to hold the flipper up to get the ball to a cradle.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Black Jack [SS - Bally, 1978]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Right side saucer all day when lit, otherwise UTAD through the left side spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Left whenever &ldquo;Player Wins&rdquo;

try to plunge just hard enough to have the ball hit the left side black rubber pad and rebound into the top of the lane above the saucer, to then fall into it. &nbsp;If the saucer is not lit, plunge for the heart lane at the right if you don&rsquo;t already have it. &nbsp;This might rebound off the bumper below it into the saucer, too. &nbsp;If the saucer is not lit and you already have the heart, plunge for any other top lane you still need to finish the set of four suits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Collecting all four top lanes lights the spinner; scoring the diamond and the heart lanes lights the bumper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This game is totally about saucer wins shots. &nbsp;As in the card game of Blackjack, your hand needs to beat the dealer&rsquo;s hand. &nbsp;Each of your hands ranges in value from 17 to 21, and those values changes as shots are made. &nbsp;Hitting either of the two red standup targets increases the player&rsquo;s hand by one, except that when your hand is at 21, it next drops back down to 17. &nbsp;The yellow targets do the same to the dealer&rsquo;s hand. &nbsp;The top suit lanes also change the player&rsquo;s hand. &nbsp;If you currently have a winning hand, you want to do whatever you can to score the saucer. &nbsp;The saucer gives you bonus multiplier advance to 2X, 3X then 5X for the first three wins, then extra ball and special. &nbsp;EBs are obviously good, and usually worth 50,000 if EBs are off, and specials are normally set to be worth 50K, too. &nbsp;Once the saucer value is at special, it stays there for the remainder of the ball, so you can clean up with a lot of 50K shots to it. &nbsp;Bonus base goes up to 29K, so your maximum collect at 5X is 145,000, nice to have, too. &nbsp;[The machine flyer incorrectly says that the bonus goes up to only 20K.]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you currently have a losing hand, you need to change that by shooting either a player or dealer target or going up top to get a player advance through a suit lane. &nbsp;If the dealer is on 21, you obviously need to shoot just for a dealer change, just as if the player is on 17, you need to change yours to get to any winning pairing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Don&rsquo;t worry about building your base bonus, shots through the spinner and the top suit lanes all do that for you. &nbsp;Just keep getting the saucer when you win, the lit spinner when you&rsquo;d lose, and a change via target or spinner is any other situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Finishing your suits also lights the outlanes for 50,000, which if collected each ball is another 150K that can make the difference between winning and losing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball control and transfers become critical on this machine. &nbsp;If you have the ball on the right flipper and player wins lit, finding a way to get the ball to the left flipper for a saucer shot is paramount. &nbsp;Tap pass, shatz, whatever you can, get it across and make the shot. &nbsp;Post passes can be hard on this game because the slingshot post is so close to the flipper; it&rsquo;s hard to get the normal rattle-across movement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Saucer shot rim-outs are common and can become very frustrating. &nbsp;Hard shots often lip out, and even softer ones and fall-intos from above can spin out. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t let that get to you! &nbsp;Be patient, keep trying, eventually they&rsquo;ll go in.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Blackout [SS - Williams, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Up Top until your bonus multiplier is maxed, then finish each set of standups and drops once to light the spinners and orbits, then UTAD all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Blackout is noteworthy for having been the finals machine at the first really large pinball tournament, the 1980 US Open, with over 550 players. &nbsp;I enjoyed playing it then, and still do, although it&rsquo;s hard to find these days.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One thing I like about Blackout is that all of the shots are worth making; for most EMs and many SS games, there are things that you should avoid in competition. &nbsp;On Blackout, it all adds enough value to be worthwhile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The main feature of the game is three colored target banks &ndash; five green standup targets to the left, three red drop targets in the center, three yellow-orange drop targets at the far upper right. &nbsp;Completing the red or yellow set lights the same-colored spinner for 3000 a spin. &nbsp;Completing the green bank advances the left orbit to the next higher orbit value - - 5K, 10K, 20K, 30K. &nbsp;Both the orbit and the spinners are what you want to be shooting once you&rsquo;ve got them lit or maxed out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Finishing all three colors lights the blackout saucer for 50,000 and a then-novel machine blackout effect. &nbsp;If only they&rsquo;d made the saucer lock-capable and built it to enable multiball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus goes up to 29,000 base, advanced as usual by lanes and targets. &nbsp;The top lanes advance your bonus X when completed, up to 5X for 145K overall maximum.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The general strategy is to finish the green bank from the right flipper, then UTAD from both flippers via the left orbit and top right spinner until your bonus X is maxed out. &nbsp;Once bonus is at 5X, get the red and yellow drop targets from the left flipper and keep finishing the green standups from the right one to increase the orbit value. &nbsp;Take the orbit shot at 20K and leave it there - - the left orbit value resets after making the 30K shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once everything is lit up, it&rsquo;s UTAD via spinners and orbits all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s a good tournament and learning game due to the benefit of hitting everything; the fewer shots you need to do so, the less your risk of draining, and the better you&rsquo;ll score. &nbsp;Aiming at and hitting specific targets early on is important.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Blue Chip [EM - Williams, 1976]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Up Top until you have 1-2-3, then shoot the 4 and 6 targets, then UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced at first, bias to Left flipper once saucer is lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shoot the ball up top through the spinners until you are able to collect the 1, 2 and 3 lights. &nbsp;This lights the top right saucer for 50,000. &nbsp;Then STOP shooting the top long enough to shoot the 4 and 6 targets to light Double Bonus. &nbsp;This is more important than usual: &nbsp;on this game, the numbers collected are held between balls, so double bonus stays on for the rest of the game, as does your lit saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Now you can go back to shooting the spinners, preferably the right one to try to get the ball in the saucer for 50K. &nbsp;The right spinner is only lit after you&rsquo;ve collected the 5 target, but that&rsquo;s a center shot and not worth the risk; if you hit it, fine, if not, don&rsquo;t worry about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The game has wide return lanes, so shatzing from right to left to shoot the right spinner is pretty safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Never shoot the 7 or 8 targets; they only help you light the special, worth nothing in tournament play.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Blue Note [EM - Gottlieb, 1978]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;standup targets all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;hit the top lane lit in green for 10,000. &nbsp;The Skill Shot is deactivated as soon as you hit a switch, when the value of each top lane reverts to 1,000. &nbsp;Which lane is lit appears random.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing the top A-B-C lanes is only relevant if extra balls are enabled, since that&rsquo;s how you light the saucer on the right for an extra ball. &nbsp;If EBs are off, ignore the top lanes other than making the Skill Shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The standup note scale &ldquo;do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-do&rdquo; targets on the left wall of the game are where it&rsquo;s at. &nbsp;They score 500 the first time hit, i.e. when lit, but then score 5000 per hit after that, i.e. when unlit. &nbsp;This is a unique reversal to most games - - something unlit scoring more than when it&rsquo;s lit. &nbsp;You may have to remind yourself of that as you play, avoiding the instinct to preferentially hit lit things. &nbsp;This is where the bulk of your non-Skill Shot points will come on this game. &nbsp;Ideally, try to hit all but one of the targets once to un-light them, and don&rsquo;t finish the targets!</span></p><p class="c0 c28"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you finish the standups, one will light for a Special; if you happen to hit that one, the targets then reset and revert to their initial 500 point values. &nbsp;This is BAD. &nbsp;Your ideal point-optimization situation is to have completed all but one note and just keep hitting the UNlit ones for 5000, avoiding the lit one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are two spinners: &nbsp;the central [left-most] one can be worth 10, 100 or 1000 points per spin; the right-hand spinner changes the value of the central spinner. &nbsp;While at 1000 points per spin this is good value, I&rsquo;ve found that shooting the spinner is not the best strategy. &nbsp;Balls through the spinner go directly into the center of the three bumpers, and it&rsquo;s not uncommon for those to spit the ball back down through the spinner and into the center drain. &nbsp;Unless your spinner is super-juicy, the cost-benefit just isn&rsquo;t there. &nbsp;Most Blue Notes give maybe 5-7 spins per shot; compare that to the 5000 you get for hitting each standup target already completed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The offset flippers and lack of a left outlane make ball control strategy on Blue Note, unlike most other games. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll want to hold the left flipper up at times as a kind of shield and a means to deflect the ball to the right flipper, which is the one you want to be taking your shots with. &nbsp;Ball transfers from left to right from a cradle are alley-pass-or-nothing: &nbsp;there&rsquo;s no post for a post pass, and these Gottlieb flippers don&rsquo;t react well for tap passing. &nbsp;Alley passing can be tricky, though, due to both the flipper offset and angle. &nbsp;If you weren&rsquo;t able to use the left flipper to deflect the ball to the right one and up end with the ball cradled on the left, backhanding the ball into the left side of the left-hand bumpers is actually a good plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key Feeds: &nbsp;kick out from the saucer [should go to the left flipper, but beware center drains] and balls coming down through either spinner.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Boomerang [EM - Bally, 1974]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Spinner all day is one choice; the other is shooting the two captive balls to build up the bonus and shooting A-B-C-D to activate double bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot is the top hole for 3000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When you shoot the spinner, if you get decent point action in that center circle and at the end of it the ball drops out safely without draining most of the time, stick with the spinner. &nbsp;If not, try the bonus route. &nbsp;Bonus maxes at 15000, 30K with the doubler.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Don&rsquo;t bother trying to shoot the ball into the arcs just centerward of the captive ball lanes, nor up the center to the right of the spinner. &nbsp;Neither is good risk-reward.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Bon Voyage [EM - Bally, 1974]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD via the far right outer arc from the left flipper. &nbsp;From the right flipper, shoot the saucer if at 4K or 5K, the captive ball otherwise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;get the B letter first, then work your way down from left to right until you have the O and N letters as well. &nbsp;I recommend this order since the ball tends to rattle down and to the right when failing to settle into a lane, making the B the hardest to get.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This game is UTAD from the left flipper but shoot the outer &ldquo;deflector&rdquo; lane where the ball goes up to the top standup and then back down to get deflected back into the plunger lane rather than along the rollovers left of it. &nbsp;This scores additional points [5K if you hit the standup, 3K when going back into the plunger lane], and you&rsquo;ll still get to shoot the ball up top towards the B-O-N letters just as if you&rsquo;d shot at them more directly via going up the right side star rollovers. &nbsp;The ball ends up in the same place, but you score more points en route.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The top right target also awards up to three letters when hit: &nbsp;notice it has three lights below it, &ldquo;BON, &ldquo;VOY&rdquo; and &ldquo;AGE&rdquo;. &nbsp;One of those three lights will always be lit. &nbsp;When you hit the target, it gives you any of the letters in the lit trio that you don&rsquo;t already have. &nbsp;Thus, this is the easiest way to collect letters quickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When the ball is on the right flipper, you have a couple of choices. &nbsp;The center spinner changes the value of the left-side saucer between 1K and 5K [see lights on playfield]; if the saucer value is at 1K or 2K, you may want to shoot the spinner and hope it stops on a bigger number. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The top left lane scores 3000 unless you have all 9 letters of Bon Voyage, in which case it scores a special [useless in tournaments, free game on location] and resets the letters [bad in tournament, it removes your bonus]. &nbsp;You score it by hitting the captive ball into it, which will also get you 4000 points as the ball goes up and down over the two inner switches. &nbsp;Weaker hits to the captive ball will score 1000 to 4000 depending on how far up they go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus [letters] carries over from ball to ball.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Bow and Arrow [EM - Bally, 1975]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Spinners until the saucer is worth 5K or more. &nbsp;At that point, saucer all day from the right flipper and transfer to the right flipper [preferred] or spinners all day from the left flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;center saucer for 3K and open gate. &nbsp;4K and 5K are okay, but opening the gate is worth the point differential. &nbsp;If you can, plunge so the ball hits one or both of the 500-point star rollovers disks before dropping into the top saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Use the spinners to advance bonus. &nbsp;Collect bonus in saucer in upper left. &nbsp;Once bonus 7000+ [higher or lower depending on your shot-making percentage and match score situation], shoot the saucer all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feed: &nbsp;saucer kickout. &nbsp;You may be able to repeat this shot several times via either one-timing it properly or live catching it on the right flipper, then shooting it again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hitting any of the A,B,C,D standups lights the corresponding bumper; getting all four standups activates Double Bonus. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re not worth shooting at, though, IMO, due to rebound risk. &nbsp;But if you have collected 3 of them at some point for whatever reason, go ahead and shoot the final one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Only shoot for the center extra ball target if it&rsquo;s turned on; otherwise, it&rsquo;s too risky. &nbsp;If enabled, the EB light activates when bonus is maxed at 10K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Don&rsquo;t bother shooting the gate even if it&rsquo;s open as you don&rsquo;t have a good angle on it from the flippers but do try to nudge the ball through it if it&rsquo;s in the vicinity.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Bristol Hills [EM - Gottlieb, 1971]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD via spinners.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is a limited release add-a-ball version of 2-player Snow Derby, with special backglass art, produced for sale in upstate New York. &nbsp;Bristol Mountain is a ski area about 50 miles from where I lived at the time. &nbsp;The add-a-balls were score-based, not game feature-based.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Scoring on this game is extremely weighted towards the last-two-balls. &nbsp;Balls 1, 2 and 3 are single bonus, i.e. 50 points per lap; ball 4 is 100 double at per lap; ball 5 is at 200 per lap. &nbsp;In addition, the top 50-point saucers add one lit saucer each ball, and other than the bonus, this is where the next most of your points will come from. &nbsp;If you can, you want to get into a &ldquo;ball in lit saucer kicks out and bounces back off a bumper into a lit saucer&rdquo; rhythm on balls 4 and 5 in particular. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll find that most of your score is on balls 4 and 5.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Getting the ball to exit out the right side lane in the middle of the machine, where it goes back to the plunger lane, is desirable whenever you can do it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Bronco [EM &ndash;

these are shatzable, but doing so is risky since the ball often ends up in the outlane afterwards. &nbsp;Base bonus goes up to 15K for max of 30K, or 60K on final ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing the three drop targets also lights the upper side lanes &ldquo;occasionally&rdquo; for extra ball; only one is lit at a time, the process cycles on switches.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;the kickouts from the saucers. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Buccaneer [EM - Gottlieb, 1976]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version. &nbsp;Get all the numbers, then UTAD for the center bumper and top center lane if you can manage it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Buccaneer is a poor tournament game but is sometimes seen in league play. &nbsp;Part of the problem with it is its narrow scoring range. &nbsp;Each of the 11 numbers is worth 5k when first scored, then just 500. &nbsp;Once the numbers are done, the only ways to score anymore more meaningful points are to hit the top bumper for 1K or go through the top center lane for 5k. &nbsp;It all comes down to how long your balls last rather than skillful shooting, assuming you manage to get all the top lanes via your plunges.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Note you can shoot the ball through the center spinner via a bank shot off the opposite slingshot.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Buck Rogers [SS - Gottlieb, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;First, hit the top center captive ball Hard until you light Return To Base. &nbsp;Next, shoot the yellow drop targets on the left until your bonus multiplier is at 5X. &nbsp;Now go UTAD on the left until your bonus collect saucer in the upper right corner is lit. &nbsp;Shoot the saucer, then resume left side UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right unless Collect Bonus saucer is lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;ideally, whichever of the &ldquo;C&rdquo; and &ldquo;U&rdquo; lanes balls shot up top through the left orbit tend to not drop into. &nbsp;You can get &ldquo;B&rdquo; and &ldquo;K&rdquo; via the return lanes, so you&rsquo;re better off not wasting a plunge on them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The yellow drop target bank on the left scores 5000 when completed and increases your bonus multiplier from 1X up to 2X, 3X, 4X and 5X. &nbsp;BUT you have to hit the captive ball until you reach Return to Base in order to light the yellow drop targets to do that. &nbsp;The captive ball can be hard to score if the flippers are weak or the game&rsquo;s slope is wrong; you may have to adjust your technique accordingly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once the base bonus is at 20K, the upper right saucer lights for bonus collect. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t want to do that unless you have a decent multiplier, though, since it wipes clean the bonus value [back to your starting 1K] when scored. &nbsp;Wait for 4X or 5X. &nbsp;Collect bonus does not remove your multiplier; if you have 5X lit, it stays lit for the remainder of the ball. &nbsp;You can thus collect a potential 100K several times in one ball even before your end of ball bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The upper left bullseye target can&rsquo;t be shot directly, but since it&rsquo;s worth 3000 points and a bonus advance, try to nudge any balls going through the &ldquo;B&rdquo; lane into bouncing off of the bumper and into that standup target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ignore the right side red drop targets completely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key Feeds: &nbsp;out of the right side EB-when-lit lane, should go to the left flipper. &nbsp;And when hitting the captive ball, try to hit it just barely off center: &nbsp;you want to hit it hard enough to make the captive ball push the pad behind it all the way up, but you also don&rsquo;t want the pinball&rsquo;s rebound to go SDTM. &nbsp;If your machine still has the center post in, with rubber on it, this is less of a risk</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If by some chance the captive ball is easy to hit all the way back and the rebounds don&rsquo;t drain, an alternate strategy is just shoot the captive ball all day and take whatever targets you happen to get along the way. Bonus is important here, but the even more important raising your bonus multiplier is a two-stage process. &nbsp;Base bonus is advanced by all lanes, targets and the saucer. &nbsp;For the multiplier, first you need to hit the captive ball hard enough to score the &ldquo;return to base.&rdquo; &nbsp;The fewer shots you take, the sooner stage 2 starts. &nbsp;In stage 2, you need to complete pairs of the now-lit yellow drop targets on the left side. &nbsp;Each pair increases your bonus X by one up to 5X. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The captive ball target scoring is tiered: &nbsp;getting it in one hit scores 10K and also lights the saucer for 5K; two hits scores 5K; three hits scores 3K, but only lights the left two yellow drop targets. &nbsp;I prefer to shoot at the captive ball from the right flipper since shots from the left that miss are more likely to graze the drop target block just left of center.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Multipliers, base bonus, bonus X and yellow targets all reset each ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The B-U-C-K letters at the top are linked to specials and can be ignored for scoring purposes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing the red drop target bank scores 10K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Collect Bonus saucer lights when base bonus is maxed at 20K. &nbsp;You can just barely shoot it with the left flipper, but you want to avoid it until you have a good multiplier, say at least 3X, since the base bonus resets after collecting. &nbsp;The bonus multiplier is held for the remainder of the ball. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve found another way to hit the collect bonus is to shoot up top from the right flipper, nudge the ball into the &ldquo;K&rdquo; lane, then nudge its bounce off the right bumper to the saucer. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re ready to collect with the ball on the right flipper and are unable to tap pass it to the left flipper, or if the left flipper shot won&rsquo;t go in cleanly, try that. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve seen the bonus collect only work once per ball in play, too; that may be a setting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s normally a center post between the flippers. &nbsp;Look to see if it&rsquo;s there, and if it is, use it!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Butterfly [EM - Sonic, 1971]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD from the right flipper. &nbsp;From the left flipper, complete the drop target three-bank once to light the double bonus lanes, then try not to shoot with the left flipper, just transfer to the right and continue UTAD with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;center lane for advance bonus. &nbsp;But &hellip; on some Butterflys, the ball will hit the top bumper and deflect to the left and out of control, while a plunge through the right-hand top lane will bounce off the same bumper to the right and down over the advance bonus and point lanes on the right-hand side, which is actually worth more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Making the three angled drop targets in the center lights set up an opportunity for Double Bonus: &nbsp;activate double bonus by getting the ball to go through either the right side return lane or the outer [left-most] left side return lane. &nbsp;While there&rsquo;s no direct shot for either of these, if you shoot the ball to the top and can get it to come back down the right side behind the drop target section, the feed from the bottom of the right side lane will go directly into the right return lane to turn on your double bonus. &nbsp;The easiest way to achieve this is to shoot the upper left side &ldquo;extra ball when lit&rdquo; lane from the right flipper hard enough for the ball to continue around the arc behind it and across to the right side of the game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is advanced via the top center lane, the three standup targets when lit [a yellow one on the left, two red ones on the right], both outlanes, the upper right side lane, the top left saucer, and the inner [right-most] left side return lane. &nbsp;While you can shoot four of these directly, I advise against shooting at any of the three standups due to rebound risk. &nbsp;Be patient and advance the bonus via the saucer and that upper right lane; any random return lane or target hits you get are a &ldquo;bonus&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">General strategy is to first max out the bonus at 100,000 with shots to the saucer or around the left side arc and down through the upper right side lane. &nbsp;Only then should you risk going for the center drop targets for double bonus. &nbsp;The drop targets themselves only score 100 at first, but their value rises to 1,000 after completing the first set and then 10,000 per target after completing the second set. &nbsp;If you have the ball on the left flipper, try to transfer it safely to the right flipper via shatzing - - the opening is relatively wide, so it&rsquo;s not too hard to do, and since there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;hard corner&rdquo; in the return lane, the ball is not at risk of going up the return lane and out the outlane. &nbsp;It will hit the hard corner, stop there and come back to the right flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The upper saucer scores 1000 plus 1000 per lit light, maxing out at 10,000, so it&rsquo;s worth shooting in its own right. &nbsp;Lit lights are earned by scoring the top red standup or top left entry lane [red light 1], left yellow standup or top center lane [yellow light], bottom right red standup or top right entry lane [red light 2] and maxing out the bonus at 100,000 [white light]. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If Extra Balls are on, you earn one by first completing the center drop targets twice, then shooting that left side arc.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feed is out of the top left saucer: &nbsp;sometimes it comes back to a flipper such than you can repeat the shot</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Capersville [EM - Bally, 1966]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;shoot the red bumper to close the flippers, then UTAD while avoiding the green bumpers as best you can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Bias Left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;Get the ball in either saucer, if empty, otherwise get it into the center lane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The colored mushroom bumpers each play a different role here. &nbsp;The red one zips the flippers together, preventing center drains. &nbsp;The blue one opens the gate at the left for access to the chute there. &nbsp;The white one advances a ball in the 4-stage &ldquo;Deep 4 Caper&rdquo; lane on the right side if one is there, or releases any balls locked in the saucers. &nbsp;Lastly, the three green bumpers reopen the zipped flippers and advance the left chute &ldquo;zapper&rdquo; value.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is one of the first multiball games. &nbsp;Get a ball in either top saucer to lock it provided there are no balls in the right chute. &nbsp;Release the ball(s) by shooting the white bumper. &nbsp;Balls can be re-locked and re-released during multiball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You can&rsquo;t shoot the ball into the left chute to collect its value; it goes in mainly from slingshot kicks. &nbsp;Both outlanes advance the left chute value, shown on the backglass via the triangle (100 points), X (300) and square (500) icons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The right chute will have the gate to enter it open when there are no balls in it or locked. &nbsp;Once a ball enters the chute, the gate closes. &nbsp;Balls are advanced in 4 steps down the chute by hitting the white bumper; once the ball gets to the bottom, it&rsquo;s returned to the shooter lane for a fresh plunge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Both locks and Deep 4 chute progress carry over from both ball to ball and game to game, so stealing locks and progress is in play here.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Captain Card [EM &ndash;

make the lit top lane for 1000; the ball should then hit the 1000 bumper and rebound off it into either the Ace of Spades [right] or the Jack of Diamonds [left], spotting you a card.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Goal &ndash; complete suits to advance bonus value; bonus is 100 for one card in a suit, 200 for two cards, 300 for three cards, then leaps to 4000 for a complete suit. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy &ndash; try to finish suits rather than get some of each: &nbsp;12 cards total with 3 in each suit is worth 1,200 in bonus; 12 cards total in three [complete] suits is worth 12,000 in bonus. &nbsp;But don&rsquo;t finish all 16 targets if add-a-balls cannot be played! &nbsp;When you get all 16, the saucer changes from scoring 12,300 for 15 targets (3 times 4,000 plus 3 times 100) to adding a ball for having all 16. &nbsp;If add-a-balls are turned off or must be plunged, you just lost your biggest scoring opportunity. &nbsp;If you do happen to finish them just go for the bumper and lanes until the ball drains. &nbsp;The targets will reset at the end of the ball, setting the saucer value back to zero but letting you build it up again on future balls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shot choice &ndash; from a cradle, shoot the upper suits [diamonds and spades]; you can backhand the Q-J of diamonds and A-K of spades. &nbsp;All but the diamond jack and spade ace can be cross-shot. &nbsp;When the ball is rolling down the inlane towards a flipper too slowly to transfer across, shoot the lower suits [clubs and hearts]. &nbsp;The top suits can be drainy when cross-shooting, so be alert. &nbsp;The top edge cards are restively safe if you hit them on the outer edges.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus &ndash; collected ONLY at the saucer or side outlanes. &nbsp;Center drains do not score bonus! &nbsp;There are several shots to collect bonus at the saucer, none of which are high percentage. &nbsp;Which work best will vary from machine to machine depending on flipper power, machine slope and slingshot power. &nbsp;Shot 1 is direct into the saucer, but this must be very precise to avoid rim-out; try to feather the flipper a bit. &nbsp;Shot 2 is towards the gaps next to the ace of diamonds or jack of spades: &nbsp;when the ball falls back, you can sometimes nudge the bounce off the angled middle lane guide into the straight guide and then into the saucer [or directly off the edge of the angled guide]. &nbsp;Shot 3 is to bank the ball off the opposite slingshot, which angles it towards the saucer but moving more slowly than a direct shot: &nbsp;less accurate, but less likely to rim out when not precise, and less likely to drain if you miss.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">The main thing on Captain Card is to have the ball going </span><span class="c17 c5">slowly</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c17 c5">not straight up-and-down</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;in the vicinity of the hole. The Gottlieb saucers are steep-edged, which means that a ball entering one close to center-on is more likely to actually fall in than is true for a shallower bowl-shaped saucer like those on many Ballys [Little Chief, or the more common SS games like Paragon and Mata Hari]. &nbsp;Slower helps because, like a golf hole, a too-hard shot will rim out unless dead center, while a slower shot can fall in from the edge. Coming in from the side is better because if it does miss, fall short or rim out, it&rsquo;s less likely to drain down the middle. &nbsp;The highest percentage is the rattle-out-of-the-angled-lane nudge-in, made via shooting up top, but that&#39;s indirect. &nbsp;Next highest is the sling bank shot; the advantage here is it both slows the ball since the sling kicks either not at all or weakly at the proper shot angle, and that if it misses, the ball can continue higher up and turn into one of those lane rattle-out-and-ins - - while the shot itself isn&#39;t the highest percentage, it gives you two chances which total your best odds. There one more indirect way, a bank shot off the tip of those angled lane sides, but that&#39;s a really fine angle, although a close miss again gives you a chance at a rattler. &nbsp;The direct shot actually has a better chance to go in when the flippers are weak, but of course then, it&rsquo;s harder to finish the top cards.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Captain Fantastic [EM &ndash;

left of left of the red drop targets; balls shot behind the target bank do nothing. &nbsp;Second, there are two different returns lane designs used: &nbsp;the standard inlane/outlane split on the left side, but a 45-degree bounce-return lane on the right side. &nbsp;It is possible to give yourself an inlane-outlane drain on the right if a ball is coming fast towards the right flipper and you hold the flipper up to try to cradle it. &nbsp;Third, the rubber above the white drop targets on the right sticks out a bit below the bottom star rollover, so balls descending the right arc will kick off it out across the playfield.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Cheetah [SS &ndash;

if you get any out of order, you need to finish the whole bank to get it to reset for another chance. &nbsp;Lit targets (the next one you need) are worth 5K, unlit ones only 500 points. &nbsp;Getting the ball into the chute on the mid-right spots the next number. &nbsp;Completing the numbers lights the collect bonus corridor along the long left side; we&rsquo;ll get to this shortly. &nbsp;It also activates the same target bank to add bonus, scores 20K and raises the value of the next bank to 30K; later banks are 40K and 50K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus: &nbsp;advance 10K by hitting one of the right 3-bank drop targets or either outer return lane. &nbsp;Side drains give three advances (30K). &nbsp;Once you&rsquo;ve completed the #1-5 drop targets, getting them a second time advances the bonus to its maximum of 100K. &nbsp;For bonus multipliers, complete the top target 3-bank. &nbsp;After you get the side 3-bank at least once, additional completions of it also spot a multiplier and go up in value. &nbsp;Since the top bank is hard to get at, many players prefer to shoot at the right 3-bank repeatedly instead of trying to go all the way up top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Now comes the split. &nbsp;If the game is set to allow repeated bonus collection, once you have a decent bonus base and multiplier, go for that bonus collect lane all day. &nbsp;If you can only collect once per ball, you need to preserve that shot for when you have a really big bonus and make other shots to keep building it up first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill shot: &nbsp;a high-force plunge (fist bump or thumb-plunge) sometimes takes out one or more of the top drop target bank. &nbsp;Even if you don&rsquo;t get any directly, the ball will then fall into the bumpers; you want it to fall onto the center of the right bumper which can then kick it up to knock down a multiplier target or two. &nbsp;The right edge of the top bumper can also do this, about the 1 o&rsquo;clock position on that bumper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Miscellaneous other values; there are a lot of these. &nbsp;The top multiplier target banks also score increasing values each time completed: &nbsp;10K, 15K, 20K, 25K. &nbsp;The top right drop target 3-bank with the stars lights the spinners when you get three stars: &nbsp;3 blue lights the left spinner, 3 yellow lights the right one. &nbsp;You get more points for having more color-matching stars when you finish the bank: &nbsp;20K for 2, 40K for 3. &nbsp;The spinners are not as big a deal as on most games, since a lit spinner is only worth 3 times the unlit value - - 3K vs. 1K. &nbsp;The inner return lanes score an extra ball or 100K when lit; good value, but you can only nudge for it, not shoot at it. &nbsp;Balls coming back down the left corridor after a collect bonus shot falls short may drop into this lane. &nbsp;The horseshoe shot behind the upper right target bank is also an extra ball or 100K when lit. &nbsp;If it&rsquo;s lit and bonus collect repeat is off or you&rsquo;ve already used it, this is your best scoring opportunity. &nbsp;The right chute also gives 25K besides spotting a number target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While the upper left flipper is best at shooting for the star targets, the horseshoe behind them and the right spinner, you can also use it to hit the 5-bank. &nbsp;A well-timed shot will skim across the front of the targets and can knock down several of them at once. &nbsp;Similarly, you can often get more than one target in the right 3-bank with a grazing hit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball control: &nbsp;see if when you let the ball roll off the upper flipper it comes down and bounces off the lower right flipper and across to the lower left flipper such that you can then cradle-trap it. &nbsp;If it works, it&rsquo;s better to do that than to flip with the upper flipper unless you really need an upper flipper shot right then. &nbsp;You can then shoot the 3-bank with the lower left flipper. &nbsp;You also might be able to catch the ball on the right flipper after letting it roll off the upper left one; that&rsquo;s useful when you want to shoot that far left lane.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Cherry Bell [EM - Sonic, 1978]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Plunge or shoot up top to score the center lane to light double bonus at the collect saucer. &nbsp;Shoot the center saucers until one awards you triple bonus. &nbsp;After that, UTAD via the left orbit. &nbsp;Shoot the collect bonus saucer if you&rsquo;re willing to risk losing your tripled bonus and build it back up, or if doing so would give you enough to win your game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This game is mostly about the bonus and the three center saucers. &nbsp;The Skill Shot is the center lane up top, which lights double bonus - - for the collect saucer hole only, not end-of-ball bonus! &nbsp;Make sure you get this; it also scores 5000. &nbsp;If you miss the skill shot, your first priority is to keep shooting up top via the left orbit until you do get double donuns lit. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll earn more bonus advances along the way, so that shot does double-duty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You advance your bonus by one notch of 10K with the top right lane, the two star rollovers, the left orbit to the top, the left return lane and the right outlane. &nbsp;The bonus collect saucer on the upper right side is your friend - - fill up your bonus to 100K, collect it, refill it. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s your primary strategy on this machine. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center saucers give you things, but only one, triple bonus, is really useful. &nbsp;Other awards are lighting the yellow standups for 10K instead of 1000 [don&rsquo;t bother to shoot at those, lit or not], raising the right side post [reduce drain risk], an extra ball [worth it if enabled] and lighting the two special targets [worthless, never shoot these either unless they&rsquo;ve been altered to award big points]. &nbsp;The center saucers have safe kickouts, so don&rsquo;t be afraid to shoot them until you get that triple bonus lit. &nbsp;The ball won&rsquo;t necessarily go into the saucer you shoot at - - it usually rattles around in the cove there a bit before falling into a saucer. &nbsp;As for the ball-protecting post on the right, it is NOT foolproof - - the ball can creep around the edge of it and still drain out the right side. &nbsp;Treat is as an aid but not a sure thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The left top lane, also worth 500, lights the bumpers for 1000. &nbsp;Unlike most machines where the bumpers stay on once lit, either for the entire game or at least the remainder of the ball in play, on Cherry Bell, the bumpers are turned off whenever the ball hits either of the two small green standup targets right and left of the bumpers. &nbsp;That happens fairly often, so the bumpers rarely stay lit long.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">The bonus collect saucer is multiplied by only the double bonus lane; the triple bonus feature applies only to end-of-ball bonus. &nbsp;The collect saucer resets your bonus to 10,000; if the doubler is on, it stays on for the remainder of that ball. &nbsp;The bonus reset is strategically important, especially if you&rsquo;re on your last ball. &nbsp;If you have the end-of-ball tripler on with the bonus maxed at 100K, and then collect bonus at the saucer, you just potentially gave up either 90,000 points if you have the doubler lit or 180,000 points if you didn&rsquo;t have it lit. &nbsp;You traded 300K in end-of-ball bonus for either 100K or 200K now plus the </span><span class="c17 c5 c9">potential</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;to refill your bonus. &nbsp;Unless you can refill some or all of your bonus before your ball drains, you lost points. &nbsp;This means that you need to pay close attention to your score versus that of your opponents. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re last to play and behind by less than your multiplied bonus, don&rsquo;t shoot the collect bonus, just play on gently [don&rsquo;t tilt!] until you drain and win! &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re close to catching up, same advice. &nbsp;But if you&rsquo;re behind by a lot, take the collect shot and try to refill the bonus to forge ahead. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re player one or two and you&rsquo;re ahead by a good margin, you could consider not taking the collect as well and just going UTAD until you drain. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re way behind, though, as any player number, you&rsquo;re pretty much forced to take the collect bonus whenever it&rsquo;s high [say 80K or more] and then try to refill and multiply it if you haven&rsquo;t already done so. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s the only realistic way to make up a gap of several hundred thousand points on this game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Observe that at the bottom the left side has one outlane and one return lane, while both lanes on the right are outlanes. &nbsp;Which outlane on the right is better depends on your bonus situation. &nbsp;The inner outlane is worth a fixed 5,000, while the outer outlane lane advances bonus. &nbsp;This means if your bonus is less than the maximum base of 100K, you&rsquo;re better off advancing bonus by 10K (worth 30K if tripled). &nbsp;If you are at full 100K bonus base, the 5000 is better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;the kick outs from the center saucers and the bonus collect hole - - can you get the ball back to a cradle, or do you need to flip away?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Circus [EM - Bally, 1973]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Make the Skill Shot to the top center lane, then UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Making the Skill Shot here is critical and will save you having to take risky shots later. &nbsp;Drop the ball into the top center lane to light the six white rollover disks, three on each side of the upper playfield, to advance bonus [by 1K each]. &nbsp;If you go through either side top lane, only the disks on that side will be turned on for advance bonus. &nbsp;If you miss all three top lanes on the plunge, which is not just possible but common since there&rsquo;s no gate at the top of the right or left orbit, you&rsquo;ll need to flip the ball back up top to try again or shoot one of the risky standup targets below the disks to light them. &nbsp;Unlit, they&rsquo;re only worth 100 points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This game is mostly about bonus, with the other major scoring coming from the two top side bumpers once your bonus is maximized at 19,000. &nbsp;Build bonus by hitting any of ten switches: &nbsp;those six white rollovers when lit, plus the two yellow standup targets near the middle of the game and the two return lanes. &nbsp;Since both the yellow standup bonus advance targets and the &ldquo;light lanes&rdquo; standups are risky shots, I prefer UTAD to advance bonus [and to light the disks if I missed them on the plunge].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is doubled on balls 3 and 5; you can&rsquo;t double it on the other balls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Like some games, this has an extra ball feature that is on a bonus value cycle: &nbsp;it lights only when the bonus is at exactly 15000. &nbsp;Take it if you can, but it&rsquo;s usually turned off for competition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since you&rsquo;ll be going UTAD, the key feeds will be how the ball comes down each side orbit - - you may need to bump the game when the ball gets to the post below the lowest white disk - - and how the ball comes down through the center gap below the bumper. &nbsp;Most of the time it comes down the center gap, it will have traveled along the angled rubber in that section and won&rsquo;t drain down the middle, but you still may need to nudge to get the ball to come to a flipper rather than hit one of the lower slingshots or drain out the side.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Cleopatra [EM, SS - Gottlieb, 1977]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD. &nbsp;If in a situation where you can&rsquo;t go up top but can hit the drop targets in the center, hit ones that match the top lanes you&rsquo;ve scored, in preference order red, white, blue, yellow, green.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;get the red lane in the center.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This game is a combination of bonus, saucers and rollovers. &nbsp;For the best score, focus on shots to the top over the rollovers. &nbsp;Shots through the upper channels usually trip the star rollovers just below the one-way gates; these rollovers are worth 5000 per hit, the best value on the game. &nbsp;You also will get points when the ball then drops through a top lane, including a chance to get another color towards your end of ball bonus. &nbsp;The ball will then often also land in one of the saucers as it drops down the playfield, scoring more points and further helping your bonus cause. &nbsp;Also observe that shots to the top that miss may rattle around in the bumpers and or drop into a side saucer. &nbsp;If you make the shot, great, if you miss but still go through to the top half of the playfield, not too bad either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is two step: &nbsp;you only score bonus when you&rsquo;ve collected both a top lane and a drop target of matching color. &nbsp;Their bonus value differs by color, too, with red worth 5000, white 4000, blue 3000, yellow 2000 and green 1000. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s possible to double your bonus by collecting both side saucers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While shooting at the five drop targets in the center of the playfield to enable that half of your bonus is tempting, it&rsquo;s not your best strategy. &nbsp;Drop target shots risk draining if not precise, and even then, hitting a target at the wrong angle can still lead to draining.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds are the kickouts from the side saucers. &nbsp;Can you nudge for a repeat saucer collect off of the bumpers and top wedge slings? &nbsp;Can you at least get some bumper action off of the kickout?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Close Encounters [EM &amp;

the side slings below the saucer and below both right side horseshoes lower it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The game is somewhat complicated. &nbsp;You have three scoring colors: &nbsp;white, green and yellow, which start at 5K and go up to 40K in steps. &nbsp;Hits on the swinging center target when the light below it is on an advance color circle advance that color&rsquo;s value. &nbsp;The three top letters each advance a color: &nbsp;C advances white, O increases yellow, N increases green value. &nbsp;Completing the drop target 4-bank at the top left scores the white value. &nbsp;The horseshoe shot scores the current green value. &nbsp;The yellow value is only scored via the swinging target when it&rsquo;s on either of the two indicated &ldquo;scores yellow&rdquo; circles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The CONTACT letters are worthless as such, only leading to extra balls and specials. &nbsp;Their only use in competition is the color value advance the CON provide. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The recessed pad targets on the right side of the game advance the lit value of the current color.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">End of ball bonus is the current value of the active color.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The A and C standups outside the bottom swinging target change the current swinging target value, cycling it from left to right; hitting the swinging target scores its value and moves to the next value to the right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As on Space Mission, ball control is tricky with the saucers behind the flippers and now also the doubled flippers with drain potential. &nbsp;If you have the post up, by all means let the ball settle against it. &nbsp;When the ball comes near the upper flipper of each pair, you can hold them up to try to get the ball to fall into the saucer, but learn where the saucer kickouts go to see if that&rsquo;s a good idea or not. &nbsp;Since you can&rsquo;t cradle up to take precise shots, your best strategy is UTAD and just use nudging and flipper deflections to try to keep the ball safe as long as you can.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Cosmic Gunfight [SS - Williams, 1982]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Right orbit all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Left!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Cosmic Gunfight is fun to play in multiball, but you needn&rsquo;t bother to go for it. &nbsp;The best points on the game come from shooting the right orbit over and over. &nbsp;The orbit shot value goes up each time you make it: &nbsp;20K, 30, 40, 50, 60K, then the next shot starts double playfield scoring; the shot value returns to 20K after that, but now it&rsquo;s doubled to 40K. &nbsp;The doubler stay active for the remainder of the ball. &nbsp;The orbit shot value is preserved from ball to ball, so if you have 60K lit after ball one, your first two shots to it on ball 2 would score 60K, then the doubler.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">The orbit shot feeds the top three lanes, and the value for completing those goes up each time you do so, maxing out at 150K. &nbsp;These values are held from ball to ball as well. &nbsp;And, just to add even more reason to shoot the orbit, balls through the either return lane light it to give you a bonus multiplier advance [not switch hits as stated in the PAPA video]. &nbsp;Your bonus multiplier goes up to 5X, and that, too is held from ball to ball.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Completing the X-Y pair of lanes at the upper left increases the value of the top left saucer from 10K to 20K, 30K, 50K and finally 100K. &nbsp;That saucer also lights to lock a ball once you&rsquo;ve made the 1-2-3 lanes. &nbsp;Making 1-2-3 a second time also lights the saucer at the far left to lock a second ball. &nbsp;There is not two-ball multiball in this game, only a three ball one that starts immediately after you lock the second ball.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">The drop and standup targets are best ignored. &nbsp;Yes, you get some points and bonus from them, but the risk-reward is far lower than for the right orbit.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Cosmic Princess [SS &ndash;

which one alternates on switch hits. &nbsp;The other lanes each add 400 to the value of one spinner or the other, like the top stand-up targets on Trident. &nbsp;The green #1 and amber #2 add to the left spinner; orange #4 and red #5 to the right spinner. &nbsp;Four of the top lanes can be gotten other ways: &nbsp;the 2 via the standup target below the left spinner, the 4 via the standup below the right spinner, and the 1 and 5 via the left orbit shot to the top. &nbsp;The 3 you must score directly, hence its higher value. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t bother shooting at the two standups, though, just go up top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once you&rsquo;ve made all five lanes, the spinner with the pink light on to match #3 is worth 2K per spin, the other 1K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Base bonus is earned by collecting top lanes, return lanes (3 advances each) and outlanes (also 3 advances) and goes up to 19K. &nbsp;Bonus multiplier is built up by completing the drop targets the same way as on Trident: &nbsp;hit the 2nd and 4th targets for 2X + 5K; 1\3\5 for 3X + 10K; 1\2\4\5 gives 4X + 20K; all 5 gives 5x + 30K. &nbsp; Maximum collectable bonus is thus 95K. &nbsp;Both base bonus and multiplier reset each ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are so many ways to advance base bonus that any decent-length ball will max out unless you collect bonus first, making getting the drop targets for bonus X imperative. &nbsp;The collect bonus saucer at the upper left is always active. &nbsp;When collect is scored, the base bonus resets but any multiplier is held for the rest of that ball. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t shoot at the saucer directly, but balls bouncing around the top two bumpers often go into it, so when you want to collect, send the ball there via the right spinner. &nbsp;Since it&rsquo;s easy to rebuild bonus, once you have it at maximum with a decent multiplier, collecting it should be your top priority.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The outer return lanes score 2K minimum, but go up 2K in value each time you make the left orbit shot up top until worth an additional 6K each.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After you have your 5X active, just shoot spinners all day: &nbsp;left for spinner points and to the top to build bonus, right for a chance to collect it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Cosmos [EM - Bally, 1969]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Shoot the red and blue mushroom bumpers to zip the flippers and light Blast Off, then shoot Blast Off all day. &nbsp;Avoid the yellow bumpers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot is the center lane. &nbsp;Shoot first for the red mushroom bumper to zip the flippers together. &nbsp;Next, shoot at the three blue mushroom bumpers to light the Blast Off shot (upper left), then shoot that. &nbsp;Blast Off is okay any time, it&rsquo;s just worth more once you&rsquo;ve completed the blue bumpers. &nbsp;You get 100 for each hit on each blue bumper, up to 300 for each of the three bumpers, plus 10 for each base, so you can score 990 from a maximal Blast Off shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You get bonus points the more Blast Off shots you make, regardless of how much you score for each of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If the ball hits either of the yellow bumpers to unzip the flippers, shoot the red bumper again to rezip them. &nbsp;Another ball saving feature is the two small white rollover buttons near each flipper, either of which opens the gate on the lower right.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Countdown [SS - Gottlieb, 1979]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Drop target banks all day, but in color order green, yellow, red, blue the first time through. &nbsp;If you get the top saucer lit for collect bonus with 4X or 5X, take it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot is the top saucer, when lit, for 5000. &nbsp;It toggles on 10-point switch hits, including the two slings at the top, so your plunge will likely switch it on and off a few times before going in, if it goes in at all [it can go around the saucer easily, too]. &nbsp;Count your bounces while plunging in addition to trying to get the speed right to score your 5000. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you like drop targets, this is your game. &nbsp;The scoring is all drops and bonus built up from them. &nbsp;Drop target value for a given color bank goes up from 500 each to 5000 each once you&rsquo;ve completed the set once on a ball, so blast away! &nbsp;As for the bonus multiplier, this is one of the &ldquo;specific order&rdquo; games: &nbsp;finishing the green targets gives you 2X, green+yellow gives 3X, green+yellow+red gives 4X, all four colors gives 5X. &nbsp;But if you have yellow, red and blue without green complete, your bonus is still 1X. &nbsp;Your order of attack is clearly indicated here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When hitting the drops, watch out for center drain rebounds off of the green and yellow targets, especially when shot from the bottom flippers. &nbsp;Using the top flippers gives you more of a sideways angle on them for a usually safer rebound.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once your base bonus is up to 20K, the top saucer lights for collect bonus. &nbsp;As usual for these Gottlieb games, you don&rsquo;t want to collect unless your bonus multiplier is high, since the bonus value resets upon collection, although the multiplier stays for the rest of that ball. &nbsp;If your bonus is at 4X or 5X, definitely try to collect it, then refill it; 3X is optional, don&rsquo;t bother with less than that. &nbsp;You can only get to the top saucer using the upper mini flippers, bank shots, or nudges off of the top of the bumper; the bumper blocks shots from the lower flippers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If extra balls are enabled, completing 1 or 2 target banks [operator settable choice] will light the EB at the upper left lane. &nbsp;My shot for getting the extra ball is to use the lower left flipper and bank the ball off of the second blue target from the top: &nbsp;this often ricochets nicely into the EB lane!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Center Post note: &nbsp;Countdowns come with a rubbered center post, but the insert for &ldquo;same player shoots again&rdquo; that&rsquo;s just above the post is often so sunken that a ball hitting the supposed-to-rebound-into-play post won&rsquo;t do so, instead hanging up on the insert&rsquo;s edge, then falling back to drain. &nbsp;It may also bounce just enough to get stuck on the insert&rsquo;s lower edge just above the post. &nbsp;Sadly, balls there are considered drained. &nbsp;Also, the post might be removed for competition. &nbsp;Either way, don&rsquo;t rely on the post to save your ball; if it does, count yourself fortunate.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Counterforce [SS &ndash; Gottlieb, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;Drop targets all day. &nbsp;Shoot the collect bonus saucer when lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to Flipper: &nbsp;Mild bias Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Drop targets and more drop targets. &nbsp;Speed matters, though!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As soon as you hit any switch, the lights below the drop targets start flashing and move lower as time goes on. &nbsp;You need to complete the drop target bank before the lights get down to the green inserts that represent your bonus multiplier advances. &nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t, both the multipliers and the targets all reset. &nbsp;Each lit green lane is a bonus multiplier advance and corresponds to a specific bonus light and target on the playfield. &nbsp;Only the lit multipliers for targets you failed to hit are wiped out. &nbsp;If you had lights 1,3,4,5 and 7 lit for a potential 6X but failed to get the three leftmost drop targets by the time the flashing lights got down to the green inserts, you&rsquo;d lose #1 and #3 and get only 4X bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You can continue to both gain and lose bonus lights as your ball continues each time the targets reset and the flashing sequence resumes. &nbsp;The two outlane bonus multipliers can be earned during play by scoring the collect bonus saucer when not lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Each yellow lane &ndash; 3 top left, 3 top right, one on each side of the playfield &ndash; and each of the four yellow standup targets spots a drop target and scores 2K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you finish all of the drop targets before the flashing lights drop below row three, it lights the collect bonus saucer left of the drop targets. &nbsp;Base bonus goes up to 29K and the multiplier to 8X for potential of 232K. &nbsp;Base bonus resets when collected, but the multiplier stays.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Partial drop target banks and bonus multipliers are remembered from ball to ball, though your multiplier could still go down again depending on how you do with the targets on that ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy on the game is to shoot the drop targets (or hit the yellow lights) as fast as you can, hope you get some lucky bounces into the return lanes for bonus multipliers, and shoot the collect bonus saucer whenever it is lit. &nbsp;The game helps you know when time is short to finish the drop targets since the pitch and speed of the pulsing both increase.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Cross Town [EM &ndash;

it then scores that value, up to 300 points (specials are worthless). &nbsp;Each red or yellow bumper you hit raises the light below the center target for that color one notch; it rolls back down to 50 points after the special. &nbsp;Getting them to match and then hitting the target is the only partially-skill-based play on the game. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re looking for a &ldquo;coin-flip&rdquo; game against a superior opponent, this is a good one to pick.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Daffie [EM - Williams, 1968]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;UTAD to complete 1 through 5, repeat. &nbsp;Shoot the center standup for 5K when it&rsquo;s up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Similar to Doozie, but a few differences, so I list it separately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;get the ball to hit the #5 rollover at the top, then drop into any of the lanes numbered 1 through 4 that you still need. &nbsp;If you have none of 1-4 at the moment, try for the 1. &nbsp;This puts the ball closest to the &ldquo;open gate&rdquo; standup target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Your first order of business after plunging is to try to nudge the ball as it&rsquo;s initially banging around the bumpers to hit the &ldquo;open gate&rdquo; target at the upper left. &nbsp;This opens the gate at the upper right to return balls to the plunger lane. &nbsp;Once the gate is open, you want the ball to go through it either from a flipper shot or further bumper action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Your basic scoring goal is to get the numbers 1 through 5 as many times as you can, mostly via the center rollovers. &nbsp;You can get two numbers on the plunge, the 5 via the top rollover and one of the other four via a top lane; your Skill Shot is to do that. &nbsp;While the center rollovers give you numbers, you&rsquo;re better off not shooting at them! &nbsp;Just go the UTAD route. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re lucky, you may get a lane via the ball getting popped up it from below by the bumpers, and when the ball comes back down, it will probably hit one of the rollovers in the middle. &nbsp;Shooting the rollovers directly risks getting a bad kick off of the bottom of one of the bumpers, which is a high drain risk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While the game does have zipper flippers that can close, I tend to not risk shooting at the &ldquo;close flippers&rdquo; standup targets since 1. they&rsquo;re narrow shots and the rebounds, hit or miss, can be dangerous, and 2. most balls drain out the sides anyway. &nbsp;If you get the flippers closed by accident, fine, use the closed flippers to help trap the ball easier and use microflips to set up shots to the top. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll find that a UTAD strategy via the sides may get the flippers closed anyway, since if you miss low, the close flippers targets are just below the side gaps to the top of the game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center drop target is worth 5000 points, so go ahead and hit it whenever it&rsquo;s up. &nbsp;Once hit, it stays down until you either complete a 1 to 5 set or go through the gate, which pops it back up. &nbsp;Finishing all 5 numbers scores 3000 points, so that&rsquo;s your top goal, both for the points and to reenable the drop target. &nbsp;The game saves your partial number sets between balls, e.g. if you have all but the 4 when you drain, you&rsquo;ll just need that one when you start your next ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When going UTAD, I take a different path on Daffie vs. its near-twin Doozie. &nbsp;I find it&rsquo;s better to shoot up the sides than try to split the gap next to the center triangular wedge behind the drop target. &nbsp;Hitting the edge of the wedge gets the ball going side to side in the lower half of the game, greatly raising your drain risk.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Darling [EM &ndash;

the points in the game other than bonus are trivial. &nbsp;Yawn. &nbsp;Bonus is earned by the top lanes (two when lit), by looping a captive ball to the opposite side, by the two small rollover buttons next to the bottom of the captive ball enclosure and by the outlanes. &nbsp;Bonus goes up to 20K. &nbsp;Bonus is doubled on last ball; double bonus cannot be earned on other balls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Because the game is so unbalanced towards bonus, you rarely see it in competition; a player with a big lead is all but impossible to catch.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Dealer&rsquo;s Choice [EM &ndash; Williams, 1974]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Shoot the A-K-Q-J-10 standups from both the top and bottom right flippers; shoot the 1000/Special lane next to the upper flipper from the left flippers. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll get the 1 through 9 center rollover disks shooting crosswise at the cards from the upper flipper, although if you just need one or two to finish the set, go ahead and use a bottom flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the replay version of Lucky Ace, with the same high degree of side-to-side action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is a major factor here. &nbsp;Base bonus maxes at 10000 and is advanced by either top lane and by the three yellow standup targets. &nbsp;Specials are worth 5000 and are earned two ways: &nbsp;completing 1 through 9 three or more times or completing 10-J-Q-K-A and shooting the special lane above the upper right flipper. &nbsp;Completing the five cards also lights the return lane on the right for an extra ball, if enabled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for the 1-9 targets, crosswise shots using the upper flipper are a good way to collect those, and you will usually get a card at the same time. &nbsp;The rebound off of the card standups usually falls down towards one of the flippers rather than making it all the way across to the right outlane, although it can arc down the center at times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">From the lower flippers, shoot up the Special lane or into the cards. &nbsp;Shooting the 1-9 disks is a bit risky since after the ball goes over them it will probably hit and trigger one of the bumpers, which can lead to a drain down the center or either side.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Delta Queen [EM &ndash;

don&rsquo;t bother to shoot at it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy here is first build bonus via the top right arc buttons, double it by hitting A and B, then collect it at the upper left saucer. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Devils Dare [SS &ndash;

ball saucer to lock a ball. &nbsp;When you lock a ball there, getting the upper left 5-bank activates the &ldquo;captive pit&rdquo; area above it to lock another ball, accessed via the upper left spinner. &nbsp;Be careful when shooting the center bank since rebounds can drain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hitting one of the flashing blue stand-up targets on the left lights a return lane for a &ldquo;lights 2-ball multiball&rdquo; shot that activates the captive cave saucer lock; these are combo shots, though. &nbsp;If you get the left light-it lane, you need to immediately shoot the center &ldquo;Devils Dare &ldquo;backwards-L&rdquo;-shaped shot right of the center drop targets and have the ball go through into the saucer right to left (which means having the left target bank drop target not in your way!). &nbsp;If you score the right blue light-it lane, you must one-time the saucer shot directly from the right flipper. &nbsp;If you hit something else first after the ball goes through either blue light lane, the 2-ball lock turns off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You can play either a 2-ball or 3-ball multiball, depending on the sequence of shots. &nbsp;If you lock a ball in the cave saucer with the lights-2-ball-combo, you&rsquo;ll get a ball in the plunger lane and 2-ball multiball will start when you plunge it. &nbsp;If you lock a ball in the &ldquo;cave&rdquo; saucer and don&rsquo;t have start 2-ball active, you can get the other target bank to light the upper captive pit lock; the light there will start flashing to let you know the upper lock is enabled. &nbsp;Once you lock a ball in the pit, you get a third ball fed to the plunger lane and 3-ball multiball starts when you plunge it. &nbsp;Lock activation is preserved from ball to ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Multiball scoring features a partial playfield multiplier: &nbsp;target hits are 1000 times the number of balls still in play. &nbsp;Devils Dare has an after-last-ball bonus round if you score enough during multiball. &nbsp;Get 50K or more during 2-ball or 70K in 3-ball and you get a time-limited extra ball, which is a multiball of the same number of balls as you played to earn it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At the very top, finishing the top green drop target 3-bank lights the inner return lanes; scoring either of these lights the opposite spinner for 2K, but only if you shoot it immediately like the 2-ball combo! &nbsp;Advantage flow players on these. &nbsp;The top red target bank advances you towards an irrelevant special, but there&rsquo;s a ball-save aspect. &nbsp;The ball-save kicker in the left outlane is one of the trickiest in pinball. &nbsp;You light it by completing any of the target banks (top 4-bank twice). &nbsp;When lit, it&rsquo;s good for one and only one kickback. &nbsp;The kickback is on a manual trigger using a second button above the left flipper button. &nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t time your kickback perfectly, the ball will still drain out the left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is a large part of the game when you&rsquo;re doing well, raised by the two standup targets near the far upper right flipper (you did notice that flipper, didn&rsquo;t you?) and the spinners. &nbsp;To increase your bonus multiplier, complete the top 3-bank and one 5-bank for 2X, both 5-banks for 3X. &nbsp;I have not noticed a cap on base bonus; the base bonus score display can handle 999,000, but it&rsquo;s rare to see it over 100K. &nbsp;If you play multiball but don&rsquo;t reach the bonus-ball threshold, you get the points you did accumulate as additional bonus, but without the bonus multiplier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">During multiball, you accumulate both &ldquo;normal&rdquo; bonus subject to the bonus multiplier and &ldquo;multiball target bonus&rdquo; earned with the playfield multiplier but with no bonus multiplier applied on top. &nbsp;Base bonus is registered in the lower left display where &ldquo;player 5&rdquo; would be on a six-player game; multiball bonus is registered in the lower right where player 6 would be. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s interesting that the two different types of bonus build from different playfield features, except that the top 3-bank counts for both. &nbsp;Get as many of those as you can!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Best strategy is to go for multiball, preferably 3-ball but take 2-ball if you&rsquo;re on ball 3 unless you&rsquo;re far enough behind to need the 3-ball to catch up. &nbsp;During multiball, UTAD to try to get those top two stand-up bonus targets; when the ball is above the top or right bumper, you can get multiple hits with good bounces. &nbsp;I prefer to shoot using the right flipper to go through the left spinner or off the left 5-bank. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t forget to use the upper flipper when you have balls up top!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The pink 4-bank of standup targets on the right lights extra ball in the central &ldquo;L&rdquo; shot after you complete it twice. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a chance your tournament director will leave extra balls active on Devils Dare. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;If they&rsquo;re turned off, your EB award is 100K, which you can keep scoring with repeated shots through the center. &nbsp;The game then becomes somewhat unbalanced, so it&rsquo;s not unheard of for TDs to let you play extra balls instead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When plunging, stay alert and plan to flip with the top right flipper when the plunged ball bounces off the bumpers. &nbsp;Also, when the ball is ejected from the captive pit, it often goes right at the top flipper, giving you a shot if your reflexes are fast enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Drain warning: &nbsp;balls gently hitting the angled top of the right slingshot are prone to drain out the right outlane.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Diamond Jack [EM - Gottlieb, 1967]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Mostly UTAD, ideally shooting at the 50-point K and Q standup targets. &nbsp;Shoot the center rotating disk when it displays a number you lack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;get a lit lane for 50 points. &nbsp;I prefer the 9 and 6 lanes since after rolling through these, the ball is likely to hit a bumper and score the K or Q target, possibly bouncing back and forth to do so more than once. &nbsp;Balls missing the lanes completely and coming through on either side of the center bumper are the worst.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Your end of ball bonus is 10 points per card scored, but the game keeps track if you have finished all of them and will give you a second &ldquo;hand&rdquo; of bonuses for another set of cards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center cylinder has various cards on it, but only the three facing you can readily be hit at any given moment. &nbsp;All ten lanes on the game spin the cylinder to reveal other cards. &nbsp;Shoot it to collect any cards you lack; if the three cards you can hit are ones you already have, go up top. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t bother shooting the Jack or 10 targets above the return lanes, those shots are risky if made, riskier if missed. &nbsp;Try to pick them up off the cylinder instead. &nbsp;You might also get them by accident with a shot that&rsquo;s too weak to go up top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you&rsquo;re close to finishing all 13 cards, make your priority doing so; once complete, all 13 cards become available again for another set of end-of-ball bonus. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a lot easier to get a bunch more quickly when all 13 are &ldquo;new&rdquo; than when you&rsquo;ve already got most of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you see the ball nearing one of the side &ldquo;spin roto&rdquo; lanes, try to get it to go through there rather than roll off the other side of those triangles towards the center. &nbsp;Key feeds are how the ball comes out of these #4 and #5 side lanes, and off the triangular wedges next to them.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Dimension [EM - Gottlieb, 1971]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD via bank shots off the drop target banks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dimension is the add-a-ball version of 2001 with better artwork. &nbsp;The score values on Dimension are 10 times higher, but the playfield and strategy are the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center saucer is always worth 3000. &nbsp;This is your Skill Shot on ball one. &nbsp;Once other saucers are lit, you want to change your Skill Shot to a different saucer [see below].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">The other 4 top saucers are worth 3000 AFTER you&rsquo;ve completed the 5 drop targets of the corresponding color, e.g. 5 green targets down lights the green saucer, worth only 500 until then. &nbsp;This means that, given a choice of drop targets to hit, </span><span class="c17 c5">finish a color set</span><span class="c2">. &nbsp;Completing a color also lights the lane of that color for 3000 vs. 500 points. &nbsp;The upper colors, green and red, are better to get first since these each lights a return lane, while the lower banks each light an outlane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The kickout from the center saucer goes onto the upper right sling, but usually not causing a hard-enough kick to keep the ball up top. &nbsp;Unless the sling on your machine is snappy enough to keep the ball up top, prepare for nudging as it comes down. &nbsp;You want the ball to bounce off the red or yellow targets, or the rubber behind them, just enough to roll gently down the face of the lower slings to the flipper. &nbsp;Too hard a bounce will go down the middle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The kickouts from the other four color saucers will hit a top bumper; depending on the exact alignment, you can sometimes nudge the rebound back into a saucer [may be a different saucer]. &nbsp;If so, do as often as you can, and also change your Skill Shot to aim for that saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Avoid the 4 standup targets facing you in the center. &nbsp;These are only useful on location when they award a replay or extra ball when lit [if turned on].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball control: &nbsp;you usually can hold the flipper up and pass the ball across when it is rolling down the return lane. &nbsp;The choice of doing this or not goes with what targets you need to complete a color set first.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Dipsy Doodle [EM - Williams, 1970]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;This game is more complex than it looks. &nbsp;It starts as a UTAD game until you&rsquo;ve raised the center post, then switches to micro-flip and standup target shooting at the 1-4 targets, in order, then reverts to UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Style Alert: &nbsp;Go with the Flow!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the 4-player version of Doodle Bug. &nbsp;As such, it is better suited to competition play. &nbsp;It has two major scoring differences, though: &nbsp;first, the values are lower;

you want the 5000 [red arrow on the right] lit when it drops in. &nbsp;If that would require too many cycles from where the light is when you plunge (it&rsquo;s hard to get more than 2 changes), try to get one of the &ldquo;light bumpers&rdquo; features. &nbsp;Lighting the bumpers also lights one of the side lanes to open the bottom right gate (yellow bumpers on lights the left side, green bumpers on lights the right side). &nbsp;The two &ldquo;500 points&rdquo; choices are the least valuable. &nbsp;The top saucer also advances the target light to the next number (#1-#4, see below).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lighting both the yellow and green bumpers lights the center bumper for 1000 and lights both side lanes to open the gate, so if you already have one color lit, getting the other color becomes your best option.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">First things first: &nbsp;keep the ball up top until you have the center post raised, via either of those side lanes. &nbsp;With any luck, you&rsquo;ll get the ball to also go back up into the saucer to light the bumpers and or go through one of the upper side lanes to open the lower right gate. &nbsp;Okay, now let&rsquo;s assume the ball comes back down to the flippers with the center post up. &nbsp;Try to get the ball to settle between the tip of either flipper and the center post. &nbsp;This is harder than you&rsquo;re used to, since if you try the normal &ldquo;hold up the flipper to cradle it&rdquo; technique, the ball will roll up the flipper, over and behind the flipper pivot, and drain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Okay, assume you&rsquo;ve done a drop catch, dead bounce or whatever and you have the ball in position;

the idea now that you have your doodler running is to milk the bumpers for as many points as possible while the doodler racks up more points. &nbsp;But the topmost slingshots [the horizontal ones] and the side &ldquo;up post&rdquo; lanes also immediately stop the doodler. &nbsp;For getting the most out of your doodler, you have to hit that center target, then go up top, avoiding the &ldquo;stop doodle bug&rdquo; rollovers en route, and get as much action up there as you can in the interior area between the bumpers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Control vs. Flow Alert! &nbsp;Letting the ball dead bounce from one flipper across to the other is NOT always safe here;

while they were intended to be able to bounce the ball back into the top saucer, I&rsquo;ve seen several cases where they&rsquo;re now too weak to do so. &nbsp;Up top more often is a more viable strategy on the game when the bumpers are recently replaced, since you can then potentially advance the target sequence and light the bumpers with such shots.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Disco Fever [SS &ndash; Williams, 1978]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;Build up bonus with drop targets and lanes, build up multiplier with DISCO letters from the top two side bullseye targets. &nbsp;Once bonus is maxed, shoot the 5000 lane or go UTAD from the right, hit the far right bullseye from the left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Disco Fever, one of the rare banana-flipper games (Time Warp is the other). &nbsp;The two primary elements here are bonus and the bullseye standup target in the small alcove on the right. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll do the bonus first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill shot: &nbsp;make the lit lane, A or B. &nbsp;The lane lights flash back and forth when you plunge until the ball triggers one of the top small soft-sling switches. &nbsp;It then stops on one and changes to the other and back whenever another switch is triggered. &nbsp;This means you won&rsquo;t know the correct lane until the last moment unless you can correctly gauge how many remaining bounces it will take before entering a lane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For bonus, base is built by the lit top lane, the two return lanes, two center and three left drop targets and the bullseye target next to the top B lane. &nbsp;Bonus multiplier is earned by spelling DISCO by hitting the two upper side bullseye targets. &nbsp;You can also advance your multiplier if you make the upper left horseshoe shot when the &ldquo;spots X&rdquo; light is on in the lower left arc of it. &nbsp;That light alternates on and off with slingshot hits. &nbsp;Base bonus goes from starting value of 2K up to 20K in 2K increments, so you only need 9 advance bonus hits to maximize your base, just 8 if you make the skill shot. &nbsp;Multiplier goes to 5X for 100K potential.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing A-B advances the value of the alcove bullseye target on the right in steps up to a maximum of 30K. &nbsp;You get A and B in the top lanes and the return lanes. &nbsp;A or B is also scored by the far left side lane, which spots whichever one you need next, the A if you need both. &nbsp;You can shoot up it from the bottom, and at 5K it&rsquo;s the second-most valuable shot on the game, but it&rsquo;s a challenge with the curved flippers. &nbsp;Once your bonus is maxed out, the highest value comes from building up and hitting the bullseye. &nbsp;The bullseye target value is reset to 5K after you make the shot, so try to build it up to 30K before you shoot it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Partial completions of A-B and DISCO are held to the next ball. &nbsp;Bonuses and multipliers reset.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball control: &nbsp;don&rsquo;t shoot at the two center drops, focus on the left three. &nbsp;When the ball is on the left flipper, go for the DISCO bullseye target up top unless it&rsquo;s time to hit the alcove value bullseye target lower down. &nbsp;Transfer from the left flipper to the right whenever possible; your best play overall is to shoot the left drop targets and left DISCO advance target. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll find that many flipper techniques don&rsquo;t work at all on the curved flippers, and aiming takes some getting used to. &nbsp;Treat it as a novelty rather than a nuisance and your game will go better.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Dolly Parton [SS - Bally, 1979]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Inline channel drop targets until bonus at 5X from the left flipper, then UTAD through the spinner. &nbsp;From the right flipper, UTAD to the left of the bumpers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Shots to master: &nbsp;Inline drop targets, spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;make the top saucer. &nbsp;That gives you a letter in P-A-R-T-O-N, advancing your bonus. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s one of the harder Skill Shots due to the wide open spaces on both sides of the saucer; more than half of people&rsquo;s plunges fail to drop into the saucer at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The first inline drop target also lights your spinner, which is the best thing to shoot on the right side once your bonus multiplier is at 5X. &nbsp;Yes, you could shoot the target at the back of the drops for 20K, but it&rsquo;s a tight shot and misses can drain. &nbsp;Shoot it if you&rsquo;re accurate enough to risk it and the rebound from it is safe, otherwise stick with the lit spinner. &nbsp;On many DPs, you can backhand the drop targets from the right flipper; try it!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">End of ball base bonus is 2K per letter in Dolly Parton collected. &nbsp;You get Parton letters from the top saucer and the inline drop targets, Dolly letters from the standup targets at the upper left. &nbsp;If you finish them all, you get a &ldquo;super bonus&rdquo; of 22K locked in for the rest of the game and can start a second set of letters. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s another lock-in at two sets for 44K. &nbsp;After that, completing the letters scores a special and resets them; don&rsquo;t do that unless you get points for specials. &nbsp;Your maximum bonus is then [ [ 44K + 10x2K ] times 5X ] or 320,000. Since the 22K and 44K values hold from ball to ball, you&rsquo;ll need to get these early in the game to get a top score in qualifying. &nbsp;My general technique is just fling the ball at the slingshot left of the bumpers and try to nudge the bounces into the Dolly letters, the top saucer, or both, before the ball comes back down. &nbsp;Since the bumpers block direct shots at most of the Dolly letters, nudging skill can be more important than shot accuracy on this game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ignore the 5000 lane just below the spinner;

while they were intended to be able to bounce the ball back into the top saucer, I&rsquo;ve seen several cases where they&rsquo;re now too weak to do so. &nbsp;Up top more often is a more viable strategy on the game when the bumpers are recently replaced, since you can then potentially advance the target sequence and light the bumpers with such shots.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Doozie [EM - Williams, 1968]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;UTAD to complete 1 through 5, repeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Similar to Daffie, but a few differences, so I list it separately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;get the ball to hit the #5 rollover at the top, then drop into any of the lanes numbered 1 through 4 that you still need. &nbsp;If you have none of 1-4 at the moment, try for the 1. &nbsp;This puts the ball closest to the &ldquo;open gate&rdquo; standup target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Your first order of business after plunging is to try to nudge the ball as it&rsquo;s initially banging around the bumpers to hit the &ldquo;open gate&rdquo; target at the upper left. &nbsp;This opens the gate at the upper right to return balls to the plunger lane. Once the gate is open, you want the ball to go through it either from a flipper shot or further bumper action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Your basic scoring goal is to get the numbers 1 through 5 as many times as you can, mostly via the center rollovers. &nbsp;You can get two numbers on the plunge, the 5 via the top rollover and one of the other four via a top lane; your Skill Shot is to do that. &nbsp;While the center rollovers give you numbers, you&rsquo;re better off not shooting at them! &nbsp;Just go the UTAD route. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re lucky, you may get a lane via the ball getting popped up it from below by the bumpers, and when the ball comes back down, it will probably hit one of the rollovers in the middle. &nbsp;Shooting the rollovers directly risks getting a bad kick off the bottom of one of the bumpers, which is a high drain risk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While the game does have zipper flippers that can close, I tend to not risk shooting at the &ldquo;close flippers&rdquo; standup targets since 1. they&rsquo;re narrow shots and the rebounds, hit or miss, can be dangerous, and 2. most balls drain out the sides anyway. &nbsp;If you get the flippers closed by accident, fine, use the closed flippers to help trap the ball easier and use microflips to set up shots to the top. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll find that a UTAD strategy via the sides may get the flippers closed anyway, since if you miss low, the close flippers targets are just below the side gaps to the top of the game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Finishing all 5 numbers scores 300 points. &nbsp;Other than random bumper action, most of your points will come from completing number sets. &nbsp;The game saves your partial number sets between balls, e.g. if you have all but the 4 when you drain, you&rsquo;ll just need that one when you start your next ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When going UTAD, I take a different path on Doozie vs. its near-twin Daffie. &nbsp;I find it&rsquo;s better to shoot between the bumpers rather than try to go outside them. &nbsp;The gap between the center and side bumpers is wider than the gap along the sides, and it&rsquo;s hard to aim precisely with these flippers, so your chances of getting through are better with the wider paths. &nbsp;Odds are that the ball will graze the edge of one of the bumpers anyway, which makes it more likely it will start to rattle around up there like you want it to. &nbsp;The thing you most want to avoid is hitting the underside of one of the lower three bumpers directly and having the rebound drain.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Dracula [SS - Stern, 1979]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;from the lower left flipper, UTAD through the spinner, then using the upper left flipper to shoot the drop target bank when doing so. &nbsp;From the right flipper, shoot the left side drop target three-bank all day. &nbsp;When the collect bonus saucer is lit for 14K or more, shoot it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Mild bias Left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot is a plunge-and-flip: &nbsp;a full plunge will loop around to the upper left flipper, where you can shoot for the drop target bank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You bonus multiplier, 2X, lights via either making three &ldquo;star&rdquo; loop shots around the left side circle around the saucer or completing the left drop target three-bank twice. &nbsp;Each also scores points; the drop target set gives 3K the first two sets, then 7K thereafter and is the better strategy of the two. &nbsp;The circle shot becomes worth 10K after the third one, but there&rsquo;s more drain risk from that shot since it&rsquo;s tight with posts beside it. &nbsp;On your last ball, the 2X multiplier randomly alternates with a 5X multiplier; ideally, when you drain, you want to &ldquo;drain wisely&rdquo; with the 5X lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Base bonus goes up to 20K, but goes up in 2000 increments, not the usual 1000. &nbsp;It can be collected at the saucer, which resets it to 2000. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t bother shooting the saucer to collect it unless you&rsquo;re at 14K or more. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s usually possible to backhand the saucer from the left flipper. &nbsp;Collect bonus includes the multiplier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The spinner is lit in an unusual way: &nbsp;rather than &ldquo;by skill,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s lit at particular values of end-of-ball base bonus: &nbsp;2000, 8000, 14000 and the maximum, 20000. &nbsp;The only way to put it on to stay is to max out your bonus [and not collect the bonus]. &nbsp;Lit value is 1K per spin vs. 100 normal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The top bumper is worth 1000 and a bonus advance, while the other bumpers are only worth 100.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Generally ignore the right side X-Y-Z standup targets, but the fourth stand up target, the one above the X, registers a star loop just like shooting the left circle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You can sometimes get a star loop while shooting the left side drop targets - - the rebounds occasionally go around the loop counterclockwise; just one more reason not to shoot the loop directly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If for some reason specials are set to award points, an alternate strategy is to get X-Y-Z, then shoot the Y all day. &nbsp;The second and subsequent post-set Y shots award a special. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s better than trying to shatz for EBs or specials, since shatzes often go inlane-outlane.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Dragon (&ldquo;bao&rdquo;) [EM - Interflip, 1977]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD, via the sides, not the center.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Shots to master: &nbsp;Up each side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Light the bumpers going through the top lanes: #1 lights the left bumper, #3 the center one, #5 the right. &nbsp;I tend to prefer soft plunging for the 5, since the ball hits the side bumpers more often than the center one, plus it&rsquo;s the easiest to get. &nbsp;Avoid the 2 and 4 lanes, they don&rsquo;t light a bumper and the ball falls through them to the middle without hitting any bumpers; plunges to the 1, 3 or 5 will usually hit the bumper below them at least once. &nbsp;Then hit the bumpers all day. &nbsp;Shoot the ball up the sides of the game rather than between the drop targets in the middle. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ignore the dragon drop targets themselves. &nbsp;If you accidentally light the extra ball stand-up in the center and EBs are on, go ahead and shoot it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The &ldquo;bao&rdquo;

one&rsquo;s always lit, which one is lit changes with spinner hits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If EBs are on, they&rsquo;re only available when the base bonus is at specified values: &nbsp;the upper left EB target at 6K and 16K, the upper right EB target at 7K and 17K, and the special lane at 8K and 18K. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;ve gone past this and have your bonus maxed at 19K, don&rsquo;t worry, there&rsquo;s still a way to score them! &nbsp;The vari-targets are mini-collect bonus features, collecting 1K, 2K or 3K when hit, depending on how far back you push the target. &nbsp;That lets you &ldquo;drop down&rdquo; to lower bonus values to relight the EBs or special. &nbsp;And you don&rsquo;t lose anything since the bonus collect applies your multiplier, if any. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s actually good to shoot them when at max bonus, since you can then rebuild your bonus. &nbsp;A full-depth shot to either vari-target also lights the spinner for 1K per spin, although most Dragons have not-too-juicy spinners.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Drop-A-Card [EM - Gottlieb, 1971]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;complete the drop targets, then UTAD, trying to get the ball to go through a 500 lane at the upper sides.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Style Alert: &nbsp;Go with the Flow!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Skill Shot is the lit top lane;

the targets reset when you lock the first ball. &nbsp;Completing this set lights the top left lock saucer; this is the location where you shoot to go to the lower level on Black Hole. &nbsp;Once both balls are locked, you plunge to start a three-ball multiball. &nbsp;Scoring is tripled while all three balls are still in play, then drops to 2X once you&rsquo;re down to two balls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is built by lanes and drop targets. &nbsp;Bonus multiplier is advanced in individual stages: &nbsp;get the left saucer for 2X;

1-4 at the top lanes, 5 and 6 are standup targets left and right, the 7 is the only return lane, on the right. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t get the 7 by skill, you&rsquo;ll just have to hope the ball drops into it instead of the outlane somewhere along the way. &nbsp;A rack is 8 balls, not 15; even numbered players play balls 8-15 instead of 1-8. &nbsp;(It </span><span class="c17 c5 c9">is</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Eight Ball, not Pool!)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot for ball one is the 4 lane, hoping to have the rebound either hit the 8-ball pad or go clockwise around the horseshoe. &nbsp;After that, the Skill Shot is whichever number you still need, unless you have all four, in which case get whichever of the 2 or 3 lanes is lit for a multiplier progress advance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">There are three priority shots on this game. &nbsp;First is the large 8-ball pad target in the upper right in front of the horseshoe; this lights the kickback at the bottom left and the spinner. &nbsp;In tournament settings, the kickback is usually NOT lit at the start of the game, making it that much more important to hit it a.s.a.p. &nbsp;On many Eight Balls, you can backhand the pad from the right flipper, in addition to forehanding it from the left flipper. &nbsp;You can also score it frequently with a counterclockwise horseshoe shot from the left flipper where the ball hits the top right bumper as it comes out of the horseshoe and rebounds into the 8-pad. &nbsp;Important: &nbsp;when the ball is saved by the kickback, it turns off both the kickback </span><span class="c17 c5">and</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;the spinner! &nbsp;You must hit the 8-ball pad again to relight them, which takes precedence over other goals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Second priority is the top left horseshoe, right of the #4 top lane: that&#39;s your bonus multiplier advance, via the star rollover at the top of the arc. &nbsp;The first two hits just advance the score value of horseshoe shots, the 3rd, 4th and 5th advance the multiplier to 2X, 3X and 5X, after that it&#39;s EB and then it stays at 5000 points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Third priority, once your bonus multiplier is maxed and the kickback and spinner are lit, is the spinner on the left, for both the points and to go back up top to collect more pool ball numbers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Final priority is to complete the set of pool balls to advance to another rack and increase your bonus. &nbsp;Like many other games of this era, completing a set of something gives you a locked-in base bonus for future balls in play and allows you to start building more bonus. &nbsp;Bonus in this case is 3000 per ball made, times bonus multiplier. &nbsp;A complete rack of 8 balls gives you 24000 base bonus, and you can then add more balls in a second rack. &nbsp;I place finishing racks as the lowest priority since you can&#39;t collect the 7 ball by normal skillful play; you have to get the ball to go into the right side return lane rather than the outlane. &nbsp;It can&#39;t be reliably </span><span class="c5">shatzed</span><span class="c2">, and any kind of bank shot to try to get the ball over to that area has a high risk of draining. &nbsp;Just hope it happens on its own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once you have the 1-7 balls, hit the 8-pad to complete the rack. &nbsp;You cannot collect the 8 until you have finished 1-7.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing the 1-2-3-4 balls to finish the top lanes will light either the 2 lane or 3 lane (it alternates) for a horseshoe advance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The rare configuration of kickback/outlane only on the left and the broad, flatter-angled-than-typical slingshot on the left side make ball control on this game unique. &nbsp;Plan on making lots of little nudges to keep the ball out of the outlane and get it to settle onto the left flipper.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Eight Ball Champ [SS &ndash; Bally, 1985]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;Left orbit all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Eight Ball Champ, last in the mini-series, is more of a shooters game than its predecessors, but in competition, your best play is to not spread your shots around but just do left orbit. &nbsp;Some tournament directors may modify it to balance the game better; check before you play if possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The green star rollovers in both orbits start out worth 5K and go up each time shot, first to 10K, then 10K at a time after that up to 100K. &nbsp;(This feature may be altered in competition, more often for the left orbit than the right.) &nbsp;A left orbit shot that continues all the way to the top right saucer also raises your bonus multiplier to 2X, 3X and 5X. &nbsp;Once your multiplier is at 5X, the top saucer scores 100K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Shots through either orbit then feed down into the top H-A-M lanes, part of C-H-A-M-P. &nbsp;Completing CHAMP turns on double playfield and raises the spinner value left of the &ldquo;H&rdquo; from 500 to 1K. &nbsp;A second completion </span><span class="c5">activates triple</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;playfield and boosts the spinner to 3K; one more time lights irrelevant specials, but does boost the spinner to 5K. &nbsp;The game comes with lane change that cycles the lanes not just for the HAM at the top but includes the C and P return lanes, so you can complete CHAMP without ever having the ball go into a return lane. &nbsp;But here, you want the ball to enter an Unlit lane. &nbsp;Like Gottlieb&rsquo;s Tag Team the same year, this game has the light indicators reversed from normal; you need to have the ball go through the lane to unlight it to score it! &nbsp;(Must be a 1985 thing.) &nbsp;The lane change feature may also be disabled in competition, in which case it may take many more orbit shots to complete HAM.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">With enough orbit shots, you should be able to complete CHAMP twice for triple playfield and simultaneously have your bonus at 5X and the top saucer worth 100K. &nbsp;At that point, saucer shots score 600K (100K rollover plus 100K saucer, both times 3X playfield), vs. the incremental value of 90K for a target (5K base at 3X playfield + 15K times 5X bonus). &nbsp;You&rsquo;re sure to get some drop and </span><span class="c5">standup</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;targets anyway, but don&rsquo;t make them your primary objectives.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Bonus can be huge, up to 3,000,000 with multiplier. &nbsp;You </span><span class="c5">get bonus</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;of 15K per pool ball or 120K per rack of 8; the 8-ball must be made last after getting 1-7 or 9-15 by shooting the left orbit all the way across the top to the saucer. &nbsp;You also </span><span class="c5">get bonus</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;of 10K per letter in E-I-G-H-T and 50K for each letter in B-A-L-L. &nbsp;The EIGHT are </span><span class="c5">standup</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;targets behind the pool ball drop targets. &nbsp;Getting EIGHT gives you a letter in BALL. Both base bonus and multiplier are held.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The drop targets reset each ball, covering up the EIGHT standups in the process. &nbsp;The 1-2 and 4-5 ball drop targets in front of the I and H standups are the more useful ones to get early, given a choice. &nbsp;To get the second ball from each target, you need to hit the drop target, then the standup behind it after which the drop target pops back up, then the drop target for the second numbered ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The game tends to play &ldquo;bouncy&rdquo;; dead bounces sometimes bounce too much and go up to the opposite slingshot rather than just across to the opposite flipper. &nbsp;You may need to live catch instead. &nbsp;Shatzing or post passing should work to transfer the ball from left to right. &nbsp;If you can&rsquo;t comfortably pass the ball from left to right, shoot the right orbit up top for more CHAMP letters and to raise that rollover&rsquo;s value. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t bother to shoot the left spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The ball has a nasty habit of hop-draining out the sides when seemingly headed into either return lane. &nbsp;If it doesn&rsquo;t drop into the return lane cleanly, watch out and prepare to nudge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Don&rsquo;t forget to use the upper right flipper for extra opportunities to shoot the ball into the top saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If the game has had lane change turned off, getting 2X or 3X playfield will require some luck with the return lanes, so now bonus becomes more important. &nbsp;You still want to shoot the left orbit to get to 5X, and orbit and top saucer shots are still good value at 100K to 200K, but the pool ball and letters are now almost as valuable if the rollover value increments have also been removed.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Eight Ball Deluxe [SS - Bally, 1981]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;From the left flipper, shoot the drop targets until complete, then shoot the 8-ball target above them. &nbsp;From the right flipper, left orbit all day unless 8 balls are complete and you&rsquo;re working on rack #2, then shoot the bonus X inline targets until at 5X, then resume left orbit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Shots to master: &nbsp;Left orbit, 8-ball, in-line drops.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sequel to Eight Ball and considered the more fun of the two. &nbsp;It has the same super-bonus for completing your eight balls, but a different layout.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot and after any shot to the top: &nbsp;nudge for the lit lane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Let&rsquo;s start with the right flipper. &nbsp;Why left orbit rather than the bonus X inlines at first? &nbsp;Simple math. &nbsp;A multiplier is worth 7000 times however many targets you&rsquo;ve collected. &nbsp;Left orbit shots are worth 70K once you&rsquo;ve made 5 of them. &nbsp;Once you&rsquo;re on rack #2, you have a minimum of 56K and will likely have more than 70K in base bonus by the end of the ball, so a multiplier shot is now worth more than 70K. &nbsp;Strictly speaking, left orbit shots when maxed out are really worth more than 70K, since you&rsquo;ll either get a top lane as well, worth either 1K or 25K, or the ball will occasionally fall back over the orbit rollover for a second score of 70k.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feed is actually out of the bumpers, which drains more often than you&rsquo;d like. &nbsp;The rebounds from the drop targets can, of course, but no two shots at them will be the same, so you&rsquo;ll have to observe and react to each. &nbsp;Also watch out for the rebound from the 8 target, which can drain down the middle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When the ball doesn&rsquo;t go all the way up the left orbit or is otherwise rolling down above the upper flipper, you&rsquo;ll need to gauge if it&rsquo;s better to flip at the 1-7 drops or let the ball roll down the front of the left slingshot, hopefully without triggering it, and then either trap it on the left or dead bounce it to the right flipper. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve found that shooting the drops with the lower flipper is usually safer than using the upper one, so I lean towards letting it roll. &nbsp;If all I need is the 8-ball, though, I&rsquo;m inclined to use the upper flipper to shoot it, since that flipper has a better angle at the 8-ball and requires less force to get the ball there.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">El Dorado [EM - Gottlieb, 1975]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c9">Quickie Version: &nbsp;</span><span class="c17 c5 c9">Lit</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;drop targets all day;

into them when the ball is coming to the right flipper. &nbsp;If it looks like the ball is headed that way in such a manner that you&rsquo;re not likely to be able to trap it on the flipper, give this a try.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">El Dorado City of Gold [SS &ndash;

mushroom bumper on the right side and #3 on the left side to light those lanes. &nbsp;Once two or more lanes are lit, shoot to the upper right for the lanes. &nbsp;[One of your misses might light the third lane anyway.]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ignore the El Toro letters otherwise unless extra balls are on and playable. &nbsp;In that case, try to finish the El Toro letters to light the top center lane to earn an extra ball. &nbsp;The extra ball lane will not always be lit even after you finish the letters; it switches on and off with the tens digit of your score.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Grazing the mushroom bumpers is better than hitting them face on; face shots can rebound in dangerous ways, while grazing hits will continue up the playfield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If the right flipper is able to backhand the right side waterfall lanes and the feed out of the lanes is good, try repeating that shot as much as possible.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Elektra [SS &ndash; Bally, 1981]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;UTAD is sort of the quickie version, but it&rsquo;s more complicated than that. &nbsp;Ideally, do a bit of everything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Elektra, the first three-level pinball machine, may be the &ldquo;most different&rdquo; game you&rsquo;ll ever play. &nbsp;This will likely be the longest of my game descriptions. &nbsp;Not only does it have three levels, it has a smooth plexiglass main playfield, curved approaches to the flippers which accentuate the plexiglass&rsquo;s slippery action, reversing timed rollovers at the upper left and two different locking processes, both three-stage! &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll be discussing &ldquo;Elektra units&rdquo; often; these are displayed in a 2-digit window at the bottom center of the backglass. &nbsp;The &ldquo;Elektra Bonus&rdquo; value, shown by surface lights at the bottom of the main playfield, is your &ldquo;normal&rdquo; bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We&rsquo;ll deal with the game in level order from top to bottom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">The ball is plunged </span><span class="c5">onto</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;the upper playfield, where a soft plunge will hit either side of the central wedge and a strong plunge will reach the upper left flipper for a shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The 1-2-3 stand-up targets in the top center need to be completed in numerical order the first time. &nbsp;Each awards 2 Elektra units when collected. &nbsp;Getting these targets lights the rollovers at the upper left; you&rsquo;ll see the lit rollover among them rotating clockwise or counterclockwise; the direction alternates. &nbsp;If you run over them in the direction they&rsquo;re moving, that lights the standups for numbers 4 through 6. &nbsp;You also light the targets for 4-6 at this stage if you make the captive ball shot three times. &nbsp;Captive balls shots also advance your bonus multiplier to 2X, 3X and 5X; after that, each shot is worth 25K plus 10 Elektra units.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once you have 4-6 lit and flashing, hitting the targets again in any order now will light the lock saucer above them. &nbsp;Finishing 4-6 also lights the star rollover just below where plunged balls enter play; depending on the settings, this can be worth 50K intermittently or a special.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We&rsquo;ll leave the locked ball discussion for a moment and head to the main playfield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The main playfield features two stand-up target banks, the red 3-bank in the center and 5 blue targets on the left. &nbsp;The 3-bank opens your ball save gate in the right outlane the first time you complete it; the second time lights collect bonus in the gate lane; the gate then closes and bonus resets. &nbsp;Set #3 releases the right captured ball to start multiball; set #4 and thereafter spot two left blue targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The blue targets enable the main playfield right lock in three stages: &nbsp;first, hit the single flashing target; you can use the left flipper button to change which target is lit like modern lane changing. &nbsp;Three targets will now flash; make those three and all five flash; make all five to light the lock. &nbsp;Repeating the cycle releases the locked ball to start multiball. &nbsp;These flashing targets also advance you two Elektra units.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The other ways to start multiball are to unlock the upper captive ball by hitting the 1-2-3 targets one more time; unlock the lower ball by hitting the main playfield center three targets; and to capture the second ball when one is already locked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are four ramps to go from the main to the upper playfield. &nbsp;The outer left ramp is the best for feeding the ball to an upper flipper since the ball will be rolling down across the face of that flipper after a successful shot. &nbsp;The mid-left and far-right ramps feed the fronts of the flippers; you&rsquo;ll get a shot, but not a controlled one. &nbsp;The mid-right ramp is one-way up only with a gate; balls bouncing down the face of the gate can often be flipped at with the upper right flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are two different bonuses, one for the upper and main playfields, the other for the lower playfield. &nbsp;The main one maxes out at 39k and 5X for 195K potential. &nbsp;Base bonus is earned by hitting the upper playfield targets, both saucers, both outlanes and when lit, the left ramp star rollovers and the main playfield red targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">The lower playfield is not used until after your ball on the main and upper playfields ends. &nbsp;It is not guaranteed to start; only if you collected 6 or more Elektra units is the lower playfield activated for additional playing time. &nbsp;Down there, you can earn up to 195K additional base bonus by hitting the targets. &nbsp;Complete either side twice to light the three arrows on that side; you then </span><span class="c5">get 5K</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;bonus per target on that side thereafter until all six targets are finished. &nbsp;You can double the bonus by shooting the lower 1-2-3 or 4-5-6 targets in order or by getting all six of them, after either of which you need to hit the flashing center 10K stand-up target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since the lower playfield bonus can go up to 390K when doubled, and you can score a lot there besides the bonus, the general strategy is to use the upper and main playfields to build up as many Elektra units as you can and then make the most of your post-drain time on the lower playfield. &nbsp;Going to the upper playfield whenever possible is a good strategy for that. &nbsp;If you get close to starting multiball, by all means do so, but it&rsquo;s less of a priority than those Elektra units are. &nbsp;During multiball, UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Elektra comes with a center post; check to see if it&rsquo;s there and has rubber on it before you play.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Embryon [SS - Bally, 1981]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD, through the left spinner and to the top right saucer. &nbsp;When the ball exits the saucer, shoot through the gate to the upper left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Skill Shot: &nbsp;none.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Embryon is a wide-body with a lot of shots available, most of which you can ignore, and an upper right flipper where shot selection actually matters. &nbsp;The plunge will go in the saucer above the upper flipper, then be kicked out to roll in front of it. &nbsp;Flip to either go through the gate to the top left three lanes [the outer two together gives you a bonus multiplier advance] or go for the closer-by drop target 3-bank.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">The drop target bank gives five different awards when completed, which one you get indicated by the flashing light. &nbsp;Three of the lights award a letter in Embryon [not a big deal, more on that later]; one gives a bonus multiplier, one awards an extra ball, one gives a special, and one awards collect bonus. &nbsp;Unless the extra ball and special give points, this makes the drop target bank something to ignore unless it&rsquo;s lit for either bonus multiplier advance or collect bonus. &nbsp;If you have </span><span class="c5">collect</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;bonus flashing, wait until your bonus is high to finish the bank and score it! &nbsp;Once you have &ldquo;used&rdquo; one of the drop bank awards, that award is locked out until you complete the entire circle of awards, at which point all become available again.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Bonus is good here, maxing at 49K and 5X for 245,000. &nbsp;Bonus multiplier is advanced three ways: &nbsp;by getting the 1 and 2 lanes in the upper left; by the third hit to the captive ball on the right side behind the single drop target; and by those top drops when lit for it. &nbsp;Embryon has the super bonus feature, where getting your base bonus to at least 20K or 40K holds that base value for future balls.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">The spinner at the upper left can give good value when lit [1000 per spin, 100 unlit]; light it by shooting the upper right saucer twice.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">The far lower right red flipper is inactive until you complete the A lane [far left] and B lane [right of the right flipper]. &nbsp;When active, you just get one flip with it, so timing is critical. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s also a rubbered post there as a second chance way to save balls in the right outlane.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Multiball is achieved by hitting the center captive ball 7 times to spell Embryon, then locking a ball in that far upper right saucer. &nbsp;Multiball is anticlimactic, though, not worth anything special &ndash; no double scoring, no jackpots, nada. &nbsp;Play it for fun if you want, but not for a higher score; rebounds from the center captive ball are a drain risk.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">The two side captive balls and the drop targets in front of them score points and add bonus, but the rebounds from these, too, are dangerous, so I avoid them. &nbsp;Same goes for the two pairs of yellow standup targets on either side of the center captive ball.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">All in all, the risk-reward situation on any shot other than UTAD makes your strategy here clear, despite the greater-than-most-machines number of different shots available to take. &nbsp;For casual play, go ahead and mix your shots up, there&rsquo;s a lot to choose from; in league or tournament play, go UTAD. &nbsp;And if you&rsquo;re good at hitting the spinner and the spinner is active and lit, try transferring a ball cradled on the left flipper to the right flipper to shoot the spinner.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Evel Knievel [SS - Bally, 1977]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c9">Quickie version: &nbsp;shoot the left drops to light one of the spinners, then </span><span class="c5 c9">lit</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;spinner all day. &nbsp;If a spinner is lit to begin the game, just do spinner all day from the start. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Shots to master: &nbsp;Spinners.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">This is one of those &ldquo;deferred UTAD&rdquo; games. &nbsp;First, you need to complete the set of five drop targets to light one of the spinners alternately. &nbsp;This also lights your Double Bonus, so you&rsquo;ve got two excellent </span><span class="c5">reason</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;for doing this first. &nbsp;Then you go UTAD through the lit spinner. &nbsp;Pay attention to the fact that balls rolling through a return lane will change the lit spinner to the side facing that flipper if that&rsquo;s not already the lit side - - the machine sets up your shot for you! &nbsp;Plan on shooting the spinner after any return lane balls - - cradle up if it&rsquo;s going slowly enough, if not, one-time it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Some Evel Knievels have one spinner lit from the start - - that&rsquo;s the machine&rsquo;s easier setting. &nbsp;If the one you&rsquo;re playing is like that, just spinner all day from the start.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Base bonus maxes out at 15K, 30K with double bonus. &nbsp;A few good spinner shots can get you that much, so don&rsquo;t sweat the bonus advances. &nbsp;The drop targets, standups, top lanes and return lanes all advance bonus, so with a decent ball, you&rsquo;ll max it out without trying to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing the right side &ldquo;C-L-E&rdquo; targets lights the center bumper; don&rsquo;t worry about that, nor the S-U-P-E-R letters, which award a special (may be set to be worth points, but again, ignore it; if you get it, fine, but it&rsquo;s not worth going for directly). &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Eye of the Tiger [EM - Gottlieb, 1978]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Complete the four colored drop target banks, ideally in this order: &nbsp;white [1], yellow [2], purple [3], red [4]. &nbsp;Then UTAD via the left orbit or center spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the 2-player version of Sinbad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sequence matters. &nbsp;You need the single white target to advance to double bonus; the two yellow targets plus the white one gives you triple; white, yellows and the three purple targets gives 4X; and adding the four red drops makes it 5X. &nbsp;But if you have nine of the ten drops and the one you&rsquo;re missing is the white one &hellip; you&rsquo;re still at single bonus. &nbsp;The order you actually hit them in doesn&rsquo;t matter, just which ones you&rsquo;ve got so far. &nbsp;If you get the white one last but do get it before you drain, you&rsquo;ll still get your 5X. &nbsp;But you want to get them in order in case you drain before you get them all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Each completed target color set also lights the corresponding top lane for the higher value - - the white lane on the right goes from 100 to 1000, the yellow lane from 500 to 5K, purple from 1000 to Extra Ball, red one from 5000 to special [useless in competition]. &nbsp;If extra balls are enabled, one strategy is to shoot for the purple targets first, then flip the ball up top and try to get it to drop through the purple lane to score the extra ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Center spinner advances bonus 1K for every 5 spins. &nbsp;Green star rollovers on the upper left advance bonus 1K each when lit; top lanes light them, one for each. &nbsp;Go up top to advance your base bonus and get the drop targets to multiply it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Once you finish the drop targets, the bonus will be collected, and you can rebuild it and collect it again. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll need to redo both the base and the multiplier. &nbsp;The bonus counting down can be distracting if you&rsquo;re not expecting it; the best thing to do is go back up top while it counts. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t have to cradle up while it does so, and anything you score while it&rsquo;s happening will be kept.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Faces [EM - Sonic, 1976]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Up Top until your both your red and green bonuses are maxed at 100K, then shoot the A and B targets for double bonus, then UTAD. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">This is a lot like Williams&rsquo; Grand Prix [wonder where they got the idea?], with separate bonuses on each side of the game and a pair of lightable spinners. &nbsp;Unlike Grand Prix, though, the bonus is not built up by the spinners but by the top saucer and the colored standup targets. &nbsp;Green bonus is advanced by the two green standup targets, the left outlane, and by the top saucer when it&rsquo;s lit for the green bonus feature. &nbsp;Red bonus is built by the red targets, right outlane, and top saucer when on red. &nbsp;If the top saucer light is on the yellow circle, you advance both red and green bonuses; that&rsquo;s your Skill Shot, also opening the gate and scoring 5000. &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Don&rsquo;t super-hard plunge, though, since the ball may hit the upper left gate, rebound fast to the right gate, then go down through left gate while it&rsquo;s still up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Which bonus is lit up top is changed by hitting the &ldquo;changes bonus selection&rdquo; target in the middle of the right side of the game. &nbsp;It also changes if &ldquo;select green bonus&rdquo; or the same for red is lit when the ball drops into the upper saucer. &nbsp;The top light cycles through the five options on switch hits much like on Williams&rsquo; Strato-Flite, so when plunging, try to get the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; number of slingshot bounces next to the saucer before the ball drops into it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Both the top saucer and the center standups open the gate, but this is not a ball-saving gate at an outlane. &nbsp;Instead, it means that shots to the right orbit will go all the way around and down the left side, rather than hitting the metal plate and falling towards the top saucer. &nbsp;In some ways, you&rsquo;re better off with the gate not open. &nbsp;Shots through the left orbit will always be stopped by the upper right metal plate and either fall towards the top saucer or rebound back down the left orbit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hitting both center targets, A and B, lights double bonus; do this, but build your bonus first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Major point: &nbsp;you only collect the bonus that is LIT at the end of the ball! &nbsp;If you have 100,000 on the green bonus but only 10K on red and the ball exits with red lit &hellip; yes, you get only 10K. &nbsp;Ideally, you want to build both bonuses up to 100,000, and better yet, do so roughly in parallel so that you&rsquo;re not &ldquo;unbalanced&rdquo; with a big bonus on one color and not the other. &nbsp;Being unbalanced is risky - - to build up the weaker one before you drain, you need to have that color &ldquo;on,&rdquo; but if you do drain before building it, you&rsquo;re out a good chunk of points. &nbsp;Makes for interesting strategy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One other way to approach being bonus-unbalanced is to let rip at the spinner - - once a color bonus is maxed, the spinner on that side of the machine will be lit for 1000 per spin, making it a good shot to take. &nbsp;The right [red] spinner is best hit from the third, upper-left flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The F-A-C-E-S rollover disks don&rsquo;t do much in competition - - they&rsquo;re mainly for extra balls and specials. &nbsp;The first time you finish them does light the bumpers and the 5000 point right-side exit lane, but you&rsquo;ll get them randomly during play on a long enough ball, so don&rsquo;t bother aiming for them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since bonus is key on this game, do lots of nudging when the ball is in the bumper / top standup targets area to get as many bonus advances as you can while the ball is rattling around there.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Fan-Tas-Tic [EM &ndash; Williams, 1972]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to flipper: &nbsp;Mild bias Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Another UTAD game, but I&rsquo;ll cover the basics. &nbsp;The primary feature is the under-playfield wheel, which scores the value the ball lands in when you shoot into any of the three &ldquo;spin&rdquo; saucers, one at the very top, the others on the mid-lower sides. &nbsp;The wheel values are 3000 (2 of these), bonus (2), double bonus, triple bonus, advance bonus to top (10K), open gate (ball return in right outlane), Light A&amp;B lanes (for 3000 per shot) and three &ldquo;stars&rdquo; which award an extra ball when you get all three (should be off in competition).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s a &ldquo;ball return lane&rdquo; (kickback) in the left outlane that&rsquo;s activated by hitting the center stand-up target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is earned with the two small rollover disks near the top and the two side-of-center stand-up targets. &nbsp;Maximum base bonus is 10K. &nbsp;Bonus, both single, double and triple, is scored by the wheel. &nbsp;Bonus is not collected at the end of the ball, only from the wheel via saucer shots. &nbsp;Bonus resets each ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The game has one of those nasty center-drain bumper layouts that can eat balls often unless the bumper is very active. &nbsp;If the bumper is weak, try to keep the ball away from it. &nbsp;If the bumper is strong, try to encourage it to pop the ball back up where you can flip it away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You can cradle balls on the flippers and should do so when possible. &nbsp;You can also lose the ball under the flippers if you miss-time a flip when the ball is near the bottom bumper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Optimal strategy is just flip the ball up top all day via the A and B lanes and hope to collect bonus advances, wheel spins and the various awards therefrom, i.e. bonus collections and lighting the A and B lanes. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t bother shooting at the three center stand-ups, nor the two side spin saucers. &nbsp;All of those are too risky. &nbsp;I list the flippers as mild bias Right because shots up the left &ldquo;A&rdquo; side go up to the top saucer area, while shots up the right &ldquo;B&rdquo; side are fed into the top bumpers directly.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Far Out [EM - Gottlieb, 1974]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Up Top until both side lanes are lit (kickback and gate), then lit drop targets all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;any top lane. &nbsp;The center lane feeds the top bumper, the side lanes will drop to the flipper on their respective sides. &nbsp;I prefer the center since you then have a chance to nudge the ball towards one of the side lanes [see below].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy: &nbsp;first, UTAD until you have both side lanes lit - - the left side lane lights the left kickback, the right side lane lights the right-hand gate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once you are &ldquo;protected,&rdquo; shoot for the drop targets. &nbsp;Drop targets have three values - - 50, 500 and 5000. &nbsp;At all times, one bank of targets will be lit for 10X [base value 500]; this cycles with switch hits [slings?]. &nbsp;There will also be one target in each bank lit for a second factor of 10X [small circle below the target.] &nbsp;Shoot for the twice-lit target, worth 5000. &nbsp;The red star rollover in the center of the game changes the lit target one step.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Targets also increase your end-of-ball bonus, as do the lanes at the top and, when lit, the bottom return lanes. &nbsp;[Light by making the lane at the top?] &nbsp;The drop targets do not reset when completed. &nbsp;Completing all targets on both sides lights double bonus;

results or test it before your game, if permitted, to see where A and C plunges go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy: &nbsp;UTAD until ball 5. &nbsp;Try to bank the ball off one of the bumpers and into one of the saucers. &nbsp;Saucers score 1000 + 1000 per A/B/C letter collected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You may see players shoot drops before ball 5. &nbsp;I disagree: &nbsp;the rebounds from the drops are risky. &nbsp;The one situation where shooting drops is okay early in the game is if you find that the rebound from a particular drop target goes up top and lands in a saucer. &nbsp;This is most likely for the top two targets on each side. &nbsp;Drop targets advance bonus; completing all drops in both banks will reset just the two center [black] targets, which are then worth 5000 each.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On ball 5, the bonus is automatically doubled, so shooting drops is more valuable. &nbsp;Bonus maxes at 15K. &nbsp; &nbsp;(When set to 3 balls, completing A-B-C activates double bonus on balls 1 and 2 and scores triple bonus on ball 3. &nbsp;On 5 balls, completing A-B-C does not change the bonus multiplier; it&rsquo;s single bonus on balls 1-4, double bonus on ball 5.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When shooting drops, try to hit them one at a time! &nbsp;While getting two at once makes better progress towards completing them, there&rsquo;s no reward for that until all ten are down [see above]. &nbsp;Until then, hitting two drops at once, or worse two on one side and one or more on the other via a quick rebound, scores only 1 bonus advance! &nbsp;Yes, the drops advance bonus, but it&rsquo;s not one advance per target down, it&rsquo;s one advance per &ldquo;registered&rdquo; drop. &nbsp;Getting more than one too quickly doesn&rsquo;t score as multiple hits; Fast Draw registers target hits slowly enough that this is a common occurrence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fast&rdquo; Draw often plays slow, so be careful when dead bouncing to make sure the ball is moving fast enough to make it across. &nbsp;But a fast-falling dead bounce will sometimes roll all the way up the side A or C lane, collecting it. &nbsp;You want that!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Fathom [SS - Bally, 1981]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c9">Quickie Version: &nbsp;lock balls in one or both saucers. &nbsp;Shoot the drop targets in front of either of them to start multiball. &nbsp;At that point, if the spinner is not already lit, shoot the &ldquo;light spinner&rdquo;

hit the standup target just left of the right side green target channel to light it. &nbsp;Bonus is multi-faceted: &nbsp;base bonus goes up to 55,000 for both blue and green bonuses; those 1K through 10K lights are cumulative, all of them lit adds up to 55K. &nbsp;The drop targets in front of the two saucers raise the multipliers for each bonus, green targets for green bonus, blue for blue. &nbsp;Your maximum bonus is then 55K times 5 for each of two colors, or 550,000 overall. &nbsp;If you reach the 55K base bonus level, that amount is held to the next ball [but not the multiplier].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Besides releasing the locked balls by completing the drop targets in front of the ball lock saucers, once you&rsquo;ve got a ball locked, getting the three matching color drop targets in the six-target bank on the left side of the game will also advance one step towards that colored multiball. &nbsp;For instance, if you have the first two green drops, the 3X and 4X ones, down, the left target bank will start flashing a green light, indicating that if you knock down all three green targets there, that will also retract the third green drop target in front of the saucer and release the ball in it, starting multiball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When in multiball, all scores are doubled for two-ball multiball, tripled for 3-balls. &nbsp;In three-ball play, that spinner is 15,000 per spin. &nbsp;One good spinner rip could get you 300,000 points. &nbsp;On many Fathoms, you can backhand the spinner from the left flipper, too. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re in multiball and have both balls cradled, one on each flipper, keep one there and shoot the spinner from whichever flipper gives you the stronger spinner shot. &nbsp;If they&rsquo;re about the same, use the right flipper unless you&rsquo;re in blue-only multiball. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;If the ball drains before you can get it back under control, your ball cradled on the left flipper can be used to relock a ball on the right / green [easier] side to resume work on your next multiball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once you&rsquo;re out of multiball, or even before you start it, you can consider shooting the spinner anyway if it&rsquo;s lit. &nbsp;It depends on how easy it is to start multiball, how easy it is to keep multiball balls live during it, and what your match situation is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For those of you new to Fathom, pay close attention to the reversed return lane / outlane sides; your nudging will need to be different from what you normally do. &nbsp;Also look closely to see exactly where the small rubbered posts are positioned below the return lane / outlane dividers; you can sometimes nudge a ball in the outlane into grazing those posts and deflecting through the gate into the return area next to the flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dead bouncing is used more than average on Fathom, especially for balls coming out of the right [green] drop target area: &nbsp;you can often just let the ball roll out, bounce off of the right flipper across the left flipper, hold the left flipper up to cradle the ball, then shoot the green drop target lane again. &nbsp;The green multiball is by far the easier of the two to start, so most players focus on it and just get blue as opportunities present themselves. &nbsp;Shooting the left orbit for the blue saucer and drops as the ball comes out of the right drop targets or saucer is a common technique for getting the blues.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center drop target 3-bank advances bonus but ignore it and focus on the spinner and multiballs.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Fire Queen [EM - Gottlieb, 1977]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Up top via the left side until you have at least three numbers;

10K, 20K, 50K. &nbsp;The release value goes up each time you play multiball, too &ndash; 50K, 100K, 150K. &nbsp;Play multiball 3 times, which requires only two shots per, and you get 200K each time you start it thereafter!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is the other source of big points. &nbsp;Base bonus is raised by the nine standup targets (1 per flashing target) and top A-B-C-D lanes (2 per lane, lit or not), up to 99K. &nbsp;Completing the top four lanes also raises your multiplier which goes up to 5X, so there&rsquo;s a possible massive 495K in bonus. &nbsp;Remember to use the lane change with the flipper buttons to help get unlit top lanes. &nbsp;Top lane completions score 25K once your bonus multiplier is maxed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus and multiplier reset each ball. &nbsp;The release light will stay on if lit. &nbsp;Release and lock saucer values carry over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for the FIREPOWER targets, completing them lights the spinner and return lanes. &nbsp;Bumpers are lit when you get any set of three letters FIR, EPO or WER. &nbsp;This also lights the orbit shot to hold bonus, but only for 7-10 seconds; make sure to shoot it when lit! &nbsp;If you get hold bonus on your last ball, it gives you one extra bonus amount but with no multiplier. &nbsp;Orbit scores 25K when not lit. &nbsp;While useful, spinner and bumper points can&rsquo;t win out over multiball and bonus here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">My recommended strategy is to ignore both the firepower letters and left ramp; you should get plenty of letters randomly during multiball, and the ramp is of little value. &nbsp;Just lock balls, play multiball and go up top. &nbsp;Once you have 5X, it&rsquo;s okay to shoot the spinner all day if lit. &nbsp;Observe that when the left orbit is lit, you need to shoot up the right side instead to get the ball to go into the top four lanes, since left orbit shots go on through.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Firepower 2 typically plays extremely fast &ndash; faster than the original Firepower.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;the return from the left-to-right orbit shot and the rebound from the Release shot. &nbsp;It really sucks when you shoot the release to start multiball only to have the ball bounce off that target and go straight down the middle, ending multiball before it even starts.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Flash [SS - Williams, 1979]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;complete the left targets to light the spinner, then spinner all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right until the spinner is lit, then Left to shoot it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Shot to Master: &nbsp;Spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The top lanes are your bonus multiplier, but this game is pre-lane-change, so you have to skillfully plunge or nudge to get all of them. &nbsp;1-2-3 awards 2X, 1-2-3-4 awards 3X. &nbsp;Bonus X resets each ball, but completed lanes carry over from ball to ball if you haven&rsquo;t got 2X. &nbsp;So, for instance, if you have the 1, 2 and 4 lanes, you keep those for the next ball, but 1-2-3 or 1-2-3-4 resets all four lanes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Max base bonus is 29K, so max total bonus is 87K. &nbsp;With a long ball, you can get more than that from lit spinner shots, so don&rsquo;t dwell on bonus. &nbsp;Nice to have, not imperative.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The spinner is lit by completing the left target bank. &nbsp;Targets score 1000 if unlit, 5000 if lit [only one is lit at a time, it cycles continuously from bottom to top], so time your shots to hit the lit target, getting up to 25K per set rather than 5000. &nbsp;Center drops are only 3K when lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing the center target bank awards Thunder the first time [5K], then Lightning [10K], Tempest [20K], and the fourth time Super Flash, worth 50K. &nbsp;Yeah, 50K is good, but given how many shots it takes and the high rebound drain risk, spinner shots have a better per-shot payoff, especially when you remember than a spinner shot will also go through a top lane for 1-4K plus some bumper hit payoff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for the right saucer, its value goes up one notch each time you complete either target bank. &nbsp;It can be a useful shot if the return from it is easily controlled. &nbsp;It can often be used as a ball transfer shot, too: &nbsp;if you haven&rsquo;t finished the left drops yet and have the ball on the left flipper, you can shoot the saucer, catch the kickout on the right flipper, then shoot a drop on the left. &nbsp;Of course, if the spinner is lit, ignore the saucer and take the spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The top 4 lanes are not equal in value, unlike most games. &nbsp;The 1 lane is worth 1000, the 2 lane 2000, the 3 lane 3000 and the 4 lane 4000. &nbsp;If you already have your bonus multiplied, you want to nudge for the 4 or 3 lane whenever you shoot the ball up top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ignore the two bullseye standup targets on the lower left and right; they&rsquo;re big drain risks. &nbsp;If you do hit them, the left one lights the bumpers and the right one lights the return lanes [for 3K + 3 bonus advances vs. 1K and 1 advance when unlit].</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Flash Gordon [SS - Bally, 1981]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Not really, but here&rsquo;s one path. &nbsp;Shoot the right side in-line drop targets for 2X and 3X [and extra ball, if enabled]. &nbsp;Next, complete the top playfield drop target bank for 4X. &nbsp;Then it&rsquo;s back down below to the left-side drop target bank for 5X. &nbsp;Finally, UTAD. &nbsp;Not optimal, but as simple as you&rsquo;ll get here. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot is to hit the lit target in the top 3-bank; the light cycles continuously when plunging, so it requires both accuracy and timing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Flash Gordon &ldquo;feels small,&rdquo; yet it&rsquo;s a deceptively fun game. &nbsp;Because the playfield is divided into two small sections, rebounds from any shot will be confined to a small space, making quick-thinking nudges mandatory to reduce drain risk. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s also a good game for practicing your dead bounce, tap pass, post pass and alley pass skills. &nbsp;The rule set is highly advanced for its time, with several separate bonuses and multipliers to achieve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The game has four bonuses: &nbsp;up to 19K regular bonus for both top and bottom playfields [advanced by shots in each]; an extra 50K upper playfield bonus if you complete the drop target three-bank when flashing; and a multi-goal 100K bonus on the lower playfield if you complete the lower target bank when it&rsquo;s flashing and have also collected both return lanes and both lower standup targets on the right. &nbsp;The extra 50K and 100K bonuses are not multiplied by the bonus multiplier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As mentioned in the quickie version, your bonus multiplier progression is the second and third inline targets on the right for 2X and 3X, the upper playfield target bank for 4X, and the lower left target bank for 5X. &nbsp;Get them all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Knocking down the single drop target above the upper flipper lets you shoot the ball back up and around into the plunger lane for collect bonus. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s also a collect bonus target at the very top center of the upper playfield which lights once you finish the flashing upper targets. &nbsp;Save these for when your bonus is high.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The target bank on the bottom left lights the spinners: &nbsp;the left spinner for the first set, the right spinner for the second set. &nbsp;You want both lit eventually.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center saucer kickout alternates bottom-top-bottom-top; the blinking light sequence under it will alert you in case you&rsquo;ve forgotten which direction is next.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are two levels of 15-second playfield multipliers available. &nbsp;Finishing the upper lit targets enables 2X, the lower targets enables 3X. &nbsp;Start the playfield multiplier scoring by getting the ball in the center saucer. &nbsp;The game will generate a light and sound show to let you know while it&rsquo;s active. &nbsp;When the multiplier is running, go for collect bonus if your value is high and the spinner if lit, otherwise shoot the drop target banks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball control: &nbsp;lots of gentle nudging and passing. &nbsp;You can usually backhand the right spinner; try it. &nbsp;When the ball is rebounding off of the upper targets, you might bump the machine forward gently as the ball is about to hit the rubber below the targets to get it to bounce across / over the center saucer feed to the rubber right of that and then up to where you can reach it with the upper flipper.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Flicker [EM - Bally, 1975]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Spinner all day is one choice; the other is shooting the two captive balls to build up the bonus and shooting A-B-C-D to activate double bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Shots to Master: &nbsp;Spinner and captive balls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is a 2-player version of Boomerang with very different artwork.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot is the top hole for 3000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When you shoot the spinner, if you get decent point action in that center circle and at the end of it the ball drops out safely without draining most of the time, stick with the spinner. &nbsp;If not, try the bonus route. &nbsp;Bonus maxes at 15000, 30K with the doubler.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Don&rsquo;t bother trying to shoot the ball into the arcs just centerward of the captive ball lanes, nor up the center to the right of the spinner. &nbsp;Neither is good risk-reward.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Flight 2000 [SS &ndash; Stern, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;Spinners all day; the right one is better. &nbsp;If you get close to starting multiball give that priority.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy: &nbsp;The safest way to big points is the rather boring right-spinner-all-day drill, ideally sweeping the three right side drop targets on several of the shots. &nbsp;If the ball is on the right flipper, shoot the left spinner-orbit up top. &nbsp;Multiball beats the spinner but can be hard to start; if you&rsquo;re behind a lot, though, go for it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing the 3-bank raises the value of the spinner you shoot through to hit it. &nbsp;It starts at 500 and goes up to 5K; the insert lights are cumulative - - you can have 500+1000+1500+2000 per spin. &nbsp;If you get all three targets in one sweeping shot, you score 50K, plus whatever spinner points you got en route.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The left spinner to the top, the other key shot, also has a wide range of values. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s just 200 to start but can be worth up to 1600 per spin before you play multiball and can then go up as high as 4K. &nbsp;It goes up for each letter you have in BLAST OFF, and after you&rsquo;ve blasted off and started multiball, the value per letter is 500 instead of 200. &nbsp;Besides spinner points, this shot gets you channel-kick points (minimum 10K), and then top lane points when the ball reenters via LAST.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To get multiball, first spell BLASTOFF; L-A-S-T you get from the top right four lanes. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s no lane change, though, and balls kicked out of the progressive channels may tend to go into the same letter, so you could need several shots to the top via the left orbit and a lot of nudging to get them all. &nbsp;There are three ways to get the &ldquo;B&rdquo;: &nbsp;either of the two standup targets tucked away just below the outsides of the LAST lanes, plus the outer left return lane. &nbsp;O-F-F you get by luck in the return lanes; the &ldquo;F&rdquo;s are the inner pair, the outer right one gives you the &ldquo;O&rdquo;. &nbsp;The inner return lanes are more valuable, giving 5K vs. 3K for the outers, and also spotting the lit number target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once you have BLASTOFF, lock three balls via the chutes at the top left and get the center and left standup targets is descending 5-4-3-2-1 order. &nbsp;The final shot has to be to lock the third ball. &nbsp;The 1-5 targets have risky rebounds, so don&rsquo;t tackle them until you have the other steps done. &nbsp;You should get two numbers when you get the two F&rsquo;s, meaning you only need three shots at the drops if you wait.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Multiball is hard to get but extremely valuable: &nbsp;just starting it should be worth about 200K. &nbsp;During multiball, the left spinner, now at 500 per letter, becomes your best choice; shots there add LAST letters and channel points, too. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You can collect BLASTOFF letters during multiball towards starting it again; you might even get all of them by the time you&rsquo;re back to single ball play! &nbsp;After you play multiball, the center recessed standup target gives you a BLAST letter in addition to points and the multiplier. &nbsp;All this makes starting multiball a second or third time way easier than the first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is not as significant as on many other games from its time; base bonus only goes up to 10K. &nbsp;Maximum multiplier is actually 15X; as with the spinner, the bonus multiplier lights are cumulative. &nbsp;You raise the multiplier either by shooting the recessed standup target between the #3 and #4 drop targets or by completing the drop target 3-bank on the right side. &nbsp;Unless you&rsquo;re very proficient at hitting the standup target and the rebounds from shots at it don&rsquo;t drain, you&rsquo;ll rarely get more than 5X.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Never shoot the ball towards the bumpers. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The game comes with a center post which may be removed or de-rubbered in competition.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Flip Flop [EM &ndash; Bally, 1976]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;flip all four flags by hitting either the standup targets below them or the small white rollovers at the top of the game above them. &nbsp;Then hit either mushroom bumper on the outside of the stand ups to reset the flags. &nbsp;Repeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Flip Flop is all about &ldquo;fun with flags&rdquo; [apologies to Big Bang Theory fans]. &nbsp;Besides getting points for flipping them, your bonus is built up with them: &nbsp;one for each flip, four for resetting them, up to a maximum of 19,000. &nbsp;This has the strange result that your end of ball bonus can only take on values of 1-5K, 9-13K and 17-19K. &nbsp;Extra ball, if enabled, comes on once your bonus reaches 11k, special (probably worthless) at 19k.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Flip Flop has one of the oddest inlane / outlane configurations you&rsquo;ll ever encounter. &nbsp;Yes, they&rsquo;re reversed, but the outer ones are only return lane if you get a good bounce off of the rubber below them, back onto the little return lane ledges by the flippers. &nbsp;Too weak, bad angle, it can still drain. &nbsp;The inner outlanes are very rarely savable, but don&rsquo;t count on it. &nbsp;And you can&rsquo;t do a roll up and back to a cradle, the ball will just roll out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Skill Shot is to hit as many of the top white rollover disks as you can before the ball comes down either side. &nbsp;When it does, you should be able to flip at it with an upper flipper; try to hit a standup target below one of the flags you didn&rsquo;t flip on the plunge. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re lucky or good, the rebound may head towards the opposite upper flipper, enabling g you to get off another such shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball control is a real challenge, both due to the gap behind the flippers and by how close the bumpers areal to them. &nbsp;Be ready to react fast!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you do get the ball cradled on a lower flipper, e.g. via a dead bounce, try to shoot it up top between the upper flippers and the mushroom bumpers. &nbsp;You can also shoot directly at a flag standup target, but that&rsquo;s the riskier way to attack them. &nbsp;Up top gives you a chance to flip more than one via the rollovers, plus you&rsquo;ll still get another crack at them when the ball comes down to an upper flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The saucers above the upper flippers, just worth points, kick the ball out low enough that you can flip at it as it exits. &nbsp;Any time you can nudge the ball into them, do so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The lower inlane and outlanes value is 500 until you get your bonus to 11k. &nbsp;At that point, one pair of them, either the inner or outer pair, will be lit for 5000. &nbsp;Which pair is lit toggles with switch hits.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Flipper Fair [EM &ndash;

it then awards an add-a-ball. &nbsp;Each green or yellow bumper you hit raises the light below the center target for that color one notch. &nbsp;Getting them to match and then hitting the target is the only partly skill based play on the game. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re looking for a &ldquo;coin-flip&rdquo; game against a superior opponent, this is a good one to pick.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The other way to add a ball is by completing the 1-2-3-4 lanes.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Flipper Pool [EM - Gottlieb, 1965]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill shot: &nbsp;collect any number you still need;

if you need either of them, the somewhat dangerous A and P stand-up targets halfway down the playfield sides are your best bet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The feed from the R and Y side lanes will generally come safely to the opposite-side flipper; some nudging off the top of the L-P or A-I section below may be required, depending on the machine&rsquo;s slope. &nbsp;The dangerous feeds are from the F and C lanes just below them. &nbsp;If the ball goes down either of these, you usually need to bump the machine to get the ball to bounce off of the divider between the T and N or G and E outlanes at the bottom to get the ball to continue towards the center of the game and one of the flippers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Force II [SS &ndash;

locks for multiball. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s key to get a lane on the plunge because the only other way you&rsquo;re likely to get one is from a shot through the top spinner with the far upper-left flipper. &nbsp;When you do have the ball on the upper flipper, go for the spinner towards the top colored lanes whenever you have less than all three completed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The two locks are one dead center and one just right of the lower right flipper. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not uncommon to have a ball go into the lower lock on its own. &nbsp;After you lock a ball, you just plunge a second ball and multiball begins when you hit a switch. &nbsp;During multiball, smack targets all day; drops score 5K, completing them scores 5K plus another 5K per lit target. &nbsp;Default setting is to have two lights on for each bank to start the game, so that&rsquo;s 15K. &nbsp;Each set completion spots another light on it. &nbsp;The two far upper left lanes score 3K per lit red (left) target and 3K per lit blue (right) target respectively, so that can be big value; with the usual 2-per-side to start, it&rsquo;s 12K initially for a ball through both.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When multiball ends, simply hit a lit target again to relight your locks. &nbsp;Stand-up targets stay lit once hit for the remainder of the game unless you complete all three;

the 1X, 2X and 3X will light cumulatively for multipliers over 3X. &nbsp;Total bonus can thus reach 174K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since so much is preserved from ball to ball, getting your stand-up targets lit on ball one is imperative. &nbsp;The more drop target set completions on ball one the better as well since their raised value is preserved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Extra balls should be off, but when on are earned by getting all three colored lanes and then finishing the upper left (white) drop target bank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The PAPA Force II in their gameplay video does not appear to score the blue drop targets properly.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Freak Out [EM - customized Williams, 1968]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;UTAD to complete 1 through 5, repeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Freak Out is a customized Doozie game with totally different artwork. &nbsp;Since PAPA has one they use in competition, I list it here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;get the ball to hit the #5 rollover at the top, then drop into any of the lanes numbered 1 through 4 that you still need. &nbsp;If you have none of 1-4 at the moment, try for the 1. &nbsp;This puts the ball closest to the &ldquo;open gate&rdquo; standup target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Your first order of business after plunging is to try to nudge the ball as it&rsquo;s initially banging around the bumpers to hit the &ldquo;open gate&rdquo; target at the upper left. &nbsp;This opens the gate at the upper right to return balls to the plunger lane. Once the gate is open, you want the ball to go through it either from a flipper shot or further bumper action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Your basic scoring goal is to get the numbers 1 through 5 as many times as you can, mostly via the center rollovers. &nbsp;You can get two numbers on the plunge, the 5 via the top rollover and one of the other four via a top lane; your Skill Shot is to do that. &nbsp;While the center rollovers give you numbers, you&rsquo;re better off not shooting at them! &nbsp;Just go the UTAD route. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re lucky, you may get a lane via the ball getting popped up it from below by the bumpers, and when the ball comes back down, it will probably hit one of the rollovers in the middle. &nbsp;Shooting the rollovers directly risks getting a bad kick off the bottom of one of the bumpers, which is a high drain risk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While the game does have zipper flippers that can close, I tend to not risk shooting at the &ldquo;close flippers&rdquo; standup targets since 1. they&rsquo;re narrow shots and the rebounds, hit or miss, can be dangerous, and 2. most balls drain out the sides anyway. &nbsp;If you get the flippers closed by accident, fine, use the closed flippers to help trap the ball easier and use microflips to set up shots to the top. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll find that a UTAD strategy via the sides may get the flippers closed anyway, since if you miss low, the close flippers targets are just below the side gaps to the top of the game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Finishing all 5 numbers scores 300 points. &nbsp;Other than random bumper action, most of your points will come from completing number sets. &nbsp;The game saves your partial number sets between balls, e.g. if you have all but the 4 when you drain, you&rsquo;ll just need that one when you start your next ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When going UTAD, I take a different path on Doozie vs. its near-twin Daffie. &nbsp;I find it&rsquo;s better to shoot between the bumpers rather than try to go outside them. &nbsp;The gap between the center and side bumpers is wider than the gap along the sides, and it&rsquo;s hard to aim precisely with these flippers, so your chances of getting through are better with the wider paths. &nbsp;Odds are that the ball will graze the edge of one of the bumpers anyway, which makes it more likely it will start to rattle around up there like you want it to. &nbsp;The thing you most want to avoid is hitting the underside of one of the lower three bumpers directly and having the rebound drain.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Free Fall [EM - Gottlieb, 1974]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;get as many different numbered lanes as you can and shoot lit drop targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Bias Left until you have all of the numbers, bias Right thereafter to shoot drop targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Free Fall is the add-a-ball version of Sky Jump. &nbsp;The add-a-ball nature changes the strategy, making it a bad idea to get all 7 numbered lanes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">This game starts UTAD, then switches to drops all day. &nbsp;The game is all about the seven drop targets - - lighting them and hitting the lit ones. &nbsp;But unlike most machines, these targets have three factor-of-ten values, not two levels or an add-a-value. &nbsp;Base target value is 50. &nbsp;This goes up to 500 for any target for which you&rsquo;ve scored the lane number corresponding to the target number. &nbsp;Finally, one target is always lit for 10 times more than whichever of these applies; it changes each time you hit the bumper that says in big letters &ldquo;moves 10X target lite when lit.&rdquo; &nbsp;[Can&rsquo;t get much clearer than that! &nbsp;I believe the &ldquo;when lit&rdquo; cycles on the tens digit.] &nbsp;The big points on this game is lighting </span><span class="c17 c5">exactly six</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;targets, then hitting the lit one, changing which one is lit and hitting the next one. &nbsp;You also get good points [5000] each time you complete the target bank, which then resets. &nbsp;Oh, yes, the numbered lanes collected carry over from ball to ball for the entire game. &nbsp;You will likely score more points on your last two balls than on your first three.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Why exactly six targets? &nbsp;In the Free Fall add-a-ball rules, once you get all 7 numbers, any lit target now becomes a &ldquo;wow&rdquo; designed to score an extra ball; in this case, zero points, assuming extra balls are turned off. &nbsp;They should be off since you can run the ball count up to 10 in the add-a-ball version. &nbsp;As for which number to &ldquo;not get,&rdquo; I&rsquo;d suggest the 5. &nbsp;You can get the 4 and 7 accidentally when the ball goes through the right-side double chute. &nbsp;You can get the 1, 2 or 3 accidentally when the ball goes through a return lane or outlane. &nbsp;And you want to shoot the ball up the 6 lane to the top at times. &nbsp;That leaves the 5 as your best omission.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;I prefer to go for the 4 lane first; you then have a chance to nudge the ball off the center bumper towards the upper 1-2-3 lanes and get a second number on the way down. &nbsp;Once you have the 4, get the 7 and 5 next in that order: &nbsp;the 7 gives you a chance to score the right side lanes, while the 5 just drops onto the bumper and starts going random and is riskier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Try not to plunge the ball into the 6! &nbsp;Really. &nbsp;Even if it&rsquo;s the last number you need. &nbsp;If you get it by accident, fine, but avoid getting it from above. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Many Free Falls are aligned such that the ball with go straight down the middle fairly often after falling through the top 6 lane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">How to get the 6 then? &nbsp;Shoot the ball </span><span class="c17 c5">up</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;the 6 from below. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not as hard a shot from the left flipper as you might think, and a successful shot will give you a chance to nudge the ball into coming back down through a different lane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;when the ball comes down either side, where does it go? &nbsp;The right side is mostly one speed, i.e. all the way from the top down, since the ball rarely goes through the gap between standup targets into it. &nbsp;You can probably let it dead bounce off of the left flipper onto the right flipper. &nbsp;You may also be able to drop catch or raise the flipper and cradle up, depending on how far up the flipper it comes. &nbsp;As for the left side, there will be two different exit speeds - - down the 1 [fast] and post-2 or 3 lane [slow]. &nbsp;Learn where the ball goes from each; nudge if necessary to avoid center drains.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Okay, let&rsquo;s assume you have the ball on a flipper. &nbsp;If it&rsquo;s the right flipper and one of the targets is lit for 5000 [both the lane has been collected and the moving light is on it], or you just have one target left to finish the bank, shoot it! &nbsp;Otherwise, shoot the ball up top to either try to collect another lane or move the lit target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If the ball is on the left flipper, you can probably not hit any target left of the 5. &nbsp;If the 5, 6 or 7 is lit for 5K or is that last target, take it, otherwise try a transfer to the right flipper or can shoot the ball up top, through the 6 lane if you can do it. &nbsp;Numbered lanes are worth 1000, so this isn&rsquo;t bad point-wise, either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One move I&rsquo;ve found useful on this game is the flying backhand: &nbsp;when the ball is coming down the right side lanes, you can often time a backhand with the left flipper to hit the 1, 2, 3 or 4 targets. &nbsp;It may or may not be riskier than trying to get control via a catch or dead bounce followed by a shot from a cradle; it depends on your skills and how the rebounds from each target go when shot from each flipper. &nbsp;If the dead bounce won&rsquo;t work [doesn&rsquo;t go far enough and drains down the middle], this is a more viable option.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Yes, that&rsquo;s the other key to this game: &nbsp;watch where your rebounds go off of the targets. &nbsp;Any that drain too often means you need to shoot that target some other way, e.g. with the other flipper, or as the ball is moving down the return lane vs. from a cradle. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is a great game for practicing your nudging and flipper accuracy skills.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Freedom [EM, SS - Bally, 1976]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Do you feel lucky? &nbsp;Freedom is all about getting the ball in the top saucer when &ldquo;lite spinner&rdquo; is lit, then shooting the spinners all day. &nbsp;Since you can&rsquo;t control which center feature is lit, it&rsquo;s a matter of luck to get the spinner item to fall your way on a shot when the ball settles into the top saucer. &nbsp;Fewer than half of the shots to the top do this due to the wide gaps next to the saucer. &nbsp;If the center wheel is currently on &ldquo;lite spinners,&rdquo; you can try to shoot the right side saucer for it, but that&rsquo;s about the only time I&rsquo;d ever deviate from UTAD.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Frontier [SS - Bally, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;shoot the inline drop targets on the left, then up top through the spinner on the right, and try to get the ball to fall into the collect bonus saucer at the top right. &nbsp;If you have a lot of predators completed, especially a full set [45K lit], get the bonus multiplier up to 4X via the drop targets on the right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Ideally, alternate; mild bias towards Left for spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;whichever top lane you have the fewest of. &nbsp;Alternately, if shots to the top have a strong tendency to fall into a particular lane, try to get one of the other ones on the plunge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Big on bonus, but two kinds of bonus, one from upper lanes and the right side 3-bank, the other from inline drops and the center target. &nbsp;The traditional bonus builds by finishing the top lanes 5 times each; extra shots through a lane beyond the fifth one don&rsquo;t advance you until you finish all three. &nbsp;Each predator is worth 3K in bonus, 45,000 for the whole set. &nbsp;You can get another full set, too; the first set is held, once completed, indicated by the 45,000 light above the predator inserts. &nbsp;The three bank on the right advances the multiplier for it up to 4X, so you can get up to 360,000 in predator bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Collecting bonus during the ball is the route to big scores. &nbsp;Shots to the left inlines light the spinner on the right and open the collect bonus gate at the top right of the game. &nbsp;Shoot the ball through the spinner and try to nudge its rebound off the top left cushion so that it falls into the collect chute. &nbsp;The collect saucer can also be scored if the ball squeezes through the gap to the bottom left of it beside the right bumper, even if the gate is not open. &nbsp;When the ball is bumping around in that area, encourage it to do so!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The predators are also advanced by hitting the three standup targets: &nbsp;one on the left, one in the center, and one on the right to the left of the spinner. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t bother shooting at the left and right ones, though, they can be drainy, and it&rsquo;s better to just advance via top lanes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The other bonus is the grizzly center one, advanced by shots to the center standup [somewhat risky], with a maximum base bonus of 60K. &nbsp;The multiplier for it is advanced via the left in-lines; the first inline lights the spinner, the next two advance the grizzly multiplier one time, and the standup behind the drops does the final advance to 4X. &nbsp;I tend to not worry about the grizzly bonus much until the predator bonus is pretty high, preferring to try to max out predator and get collect bonus (up top) after a lit spinner shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds are the rebound from the left inline drop targets and the drop-off from spinner shots that don&rsquo;t go all the way to the top but fall back through the spinner.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Fun Land [EM - Gottlieb, 1968]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version and full version: &nbsp;UTAD through the 3-alternate-value spinners, and hope the spinners stop on 500 for you. &nbsp;Bit of a luck-box game but used often enough that I&rsquo;ve included it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Fun-Fest [EM - Williams, 1972]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;raise the center post by hitting an up post rollover and activate the left side kick save by hitting either top standup target, then UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, it&rsquo;s got bright colors. &nbsp;And three ball saving features. &nbsp;But it&rsquo;s a luck box and I don&rsquo;t recommend it for tournament use.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Skill Shot is to make the center saucer for 5000 [huge points on this game], but that&rsquo;s much harder than it sounds. &nbsp;The two top lanes and top saucer all cycle on the tens digit counter, which is advanced by, among other things, the two top unmarked bumpers. &nbsp;The 3000 lanes are on a simple, on-off toggle. &nbsp;The 5000 lane is on a five-way cycle, indicated by the lights above it, advancing clockwise, i.e. you&rsquo;re one hit away when the white light at the right end of the four-light arc is lit, and you&rsquo;re active for 5000 when the orange arrow light above the saucer is lit. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re not starting with either the 5000 light already on or with the indicator on one of the two right-hand white lights, you&rsquo;re unlikely to be able to score the 5000. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s hard to get more than two bumper hits and still have the ball go in the saucer [and it sometimes goes right through the center without dropping into the saucer]. &nbsp;Focus on getting a 3000 top lane Skill Shot instead, remembering the on-off rule. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once the ball is in play, you can protect against drains down the left outlane by hitting either of the marked outer top standup targets. &nbsp;The two small &ldquo;up post&rdquo; disk rollovers next to the swinging target protect against center drains until you hit a &ldquo;down post&rdquo; rollover.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center swinging target is the other high-value item, but it&rsquo;s a risky shot due to the randomness of rebounds off it or, when you miss, the rubber behind it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">House balls are common on this game, often when the ball rolls off the center triangle above the swinging target and drains out either side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you get the center post up, let the ball settle onto it and use micro-flips to set up your shots. &nbsp;Best strategy is UTAD, aiming just to the center of the down post rollovers [you want to miss them].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The winner of the game is usually the player who gets the most lucky bounces from the bumpers into the saucer when the saucer is lit for 5000. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s also a lot of luck in draining, i.e. which value the center target is on when you drain [with or without the kicker or gate lit]. &nbsp;After the Skill Shot, 80%+ of the large points earned tend to be random. &nbsp;Even lighting the bumpers, which can add up with enough time up top, is a matter of a lucky or nudge-assisted bounce into the &ldquo;on bumpers&rdquo; standup targets - - you can&rsquo;t shoot them directly.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Future Spa [SS - Bally, 1979]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;shoot the mid-left inline drop targets in the channel to get your bonus to 6X, plus EB if it&rsquo;s either on or set to award points. &nbsp;Then UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Mild bias right until you have 6X bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One of the easier games to max out your multiplier once you have the ball cradled. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s the key, cradling. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Base bonus goes up 2K for each letter you&rsquo;ve collected in Future Spa. &nbsp;The Future letters are collected through repeated top shots with necessary nudging. &nbsp;The Spa letters are made by hitting the center standup target. &nbsp;But don&rsquo;t shoot at it, since it&rsquo;s a drain risk; you also get letters from the inlines and the kickback, so just stick with the drops and UTAD and let the spa letters come from random hits and kickbacks. &nbsp;The only time I&rsquo;d shoot the spa target is if I needed just one more spa letter to complete the 9-letter set.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When you complete all 9 letters, you light the 18K super bonus, which carries over to later balls. &nbsp;A second set moves you up to 36K, and you can also get 8 more letters for another 16K, for a max base of 52K and max total bonus of 312K. &nbsp;If you finish the letters a third time, you&rsquo;re awarded a special and the letters reset. &nbsp;If specials are set to score points, it&rsquo;s worth finishing; if not, stop one shy of your third set.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You&rsquo;ll find that you lose most of your balls down the left side on this game. &nbsp;There are four lanes on the left, with the far left one a permanent kickback award [3K, goes up 2K each time collected to a max of 9K], then an outlane, then a may-or-may-not return lane, then a return lane. &nbsp;The either-or lane is managed by a gate, which begins each ball angled to the right, making it an outlane. &nbsp;Skill shooting or otherwise getting the ball through a lit top lane [one of the two center ones] flips the gate straight up to make it a return lane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The right side top saucer and horseshoe both rise in value each time you make them, the saucer from 3K to 9K in 3K increments, the horseshoe from 2K to 10K in increments of 2K. &nbsp;Most of the time, though, you&rsquo;re better off shooting the spinner to go up top for more letters in Future. &nbsp;Only if you have Future finished would I consider shooting the horseshoe instead. &nbsp;Horseshoe shots exit to the top right bumper, which thumps them somewhat towards that saucer, so you can sometimes get three scores for one shot &ndash; the horseshoe rollover plus the bumper value and a saucer.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Galaxy [SS - Stern, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;spinner all day from the left flipper, drop target bank all day from the right flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Pretty simple: &nbsp;from the right flipper, shoot the left drop targets all day to score planets until the bonus multiplier is at 5X. &nbsp;One set gives 2X, two gives 3X, four gives 4X, six gives 5X. &nbsp;You get planet value awards along the way, too, 10K the first time and increasing by 5K each time up to 40K for Pluto.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once bonus X is maxed, or at any time earlier when you have the ball cradled and the center spinner is lit, shoot the spinner. &nbsp;At 1000 per spin, it&rsquo;s worth it, since it also gets the ball up top to do some point damage while there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Your base bonus is built up from various lanes and the star rollovers; don&rsquo;t worry about actively trying to build it, just keep shooting drops and up top and it will come.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Galaxy Lane at the upper left is generally not worth shooting unless you have most of the Galaxy letters; its value is 2K plus 3K per letter. &nbsp;I do find, though, that it&rsquo;s often useful to shoot it as a ball control strategy: &nbsp;if you&rsquo;re unable to get to a cradle and or want to take a brief pause, shooting the galaxy lane gives you a chance to refocus yourself while the ball is in the chute. &nbsp;It usually comes out in a controllable manner, and you can then figure out what you want to do next in a more relaxed manner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The top saucer is mildly useful, so try to Skill Shot into it on the plunge. &nbsp;As for the galaxy letter lanes, again, mildly useful but not worth actually taking shots at.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Gator [EM - Bally, 1969]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Hit bumper #2 [blue] to close the flippers, then shoot lane 6 to open the top gate and go through it. &nbsp;If flippers are too weak for lane 6 shot, hit bumpers #1-5, then shoot the &ldquo;gator run&rdquo; gate and repeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot &ndash; lit top lane for 100; either the center lane or both side lanes will be lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are two keys to this game: &nbsp;zipping up the flippers and opening the three gates. &nbsp;The blue mushroom bumper in the center of the game, #2, closes flippers; red mushroom bumpers #1 and #3 open the flippers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The gates are opened through various combinations of numbers. &nbsp;Open the top &ldquo;Gator Lake&rdquo; gate for 500 via either hitting rollover lane #6 or getting both yellow mushroom bumpers #4 and #5. &nbsp;Completing bumpers #1-#5 opens the middle &ldquo;Gator Run&rdquo; gate for 500. &nbsp;Completing bumpers 1-3 opens the lower &ldquo;Gator Swamp&rdquo; gate, worth just 50 points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">All six numbers, i.e. lane 6 and bumpers 1-5, are worth 100 points the first time you hit them, then drop to 10 points until relit. &nbsp;They relight when the ball goes through any open gate back to the plunger lane. &nbsp;Numbers reset when ball goes through gate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy: &nbsp; first things first, hit #2 to zip the flippers, then try to get the ball to settle onto the tips of the closed flippers. &nbsp;Use microflips to get the ball on the face of either flipper to set up your shots. &nbsp;Backhand flips are often stronger than forehand flips on this game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are two schools of thought on how to proceed next. &nbsp;Flipper power, bumper and slingshot action and your accuracy may determine which is better on an individual Gator unit. &nbsp;One idea is to go ahead and shoot the #&rsquo;s 1 and 3, reclosing the flippers by shooting #2 after each hit to #1 or #3, with the goal to complete all of 1 through 5, then shoot the middle gate. &nbsp;The other idea is to ignore 1 and 3 and that middle gate unless you hit them accidentally and go for 4, 5 and 6 and the top gate and bumpers, trying to leave the flippers closed the whole time. &nbsp;If at any point using the 4-5-6 strategy you do get the middle gate open, shoot through it. &nbsp;But remember that whenever the balls hits 1 or 3 to reopen the flippers, your top priority is to re-close them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The stronger and livelier the game, the more the up top 4-5-6 scheme is the way to go. &nbsp;With weaker action, the 1-5 middle gate is often the better of the two. &nbsp;Another way machine power impacts you play style is whether or not to let the ball come to rest on zipped flippers. &nbsp;While a settled-then-microflipped ball is under more control, if the flippers are weak, you may want to flip when the ball is first rolling or falling onto the flipper to get a little extra energy in the shot. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c28"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17 c15 c34">Gaucho [EM - Gottlieb, 1963]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UTAD unless you have the roto-target lit for 100X value with a 3 or higher value visible in either window.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to Flipper: &nbsp;

flippers makes balls drain easily. &nbsp;When the ball is up top, you must nudge a lot and hope you eventually get enough &ldquo;advance yellow&rdquo; or &ldquo;advance purple&rdquo; lanes to make the roto target worth 100 times the value shown on the dial in either window.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once the roto target is at 100X value, it becomes the most valuable in the game. &nbsp;Depending on how drainy the roto target shot is, you can then choose to shoot for it or just continue UTAD. &nbsp;Note that once you shoot the roto target, the multiplier resets. &nbsp;One of the roto target values is a star; that gives and extra ball rather than points. &nbsp;It should be left active; you&rsquo;ll need it! &nbsp;The best time to hit it is when you have no multiplier progress, that way, the progress reset won&rsquo;t hurt you later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The standup targets on either side of the roto targets light the red (left) and yellow (right) bumpers. &nbsp;The Spin bumpers spin the roto target to display two different values in the windows.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Gaucho is poorly designed, IMO. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s too drainy in general and your score is too dependent on how much bumper love you get up top. &nbsp;Replacing the 2&rdquo; flippers with lightning flippers would seem to be the best option for partial improvement; using full-size flippers might narrow that center gap a bit too much.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Gay 90&rsquo;s [EM - Williams, 1970]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD, or UTAD with pauses to shoot the hole when the hole value is 400 or 500 points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;drop the ball between the top bumpers, ideally so it rolls over the little white knob that &ldquo;scores lit value&rdquo; [rotating awards are hole advance, open right gate, open left gate]. &nbsp;A full plunge is often the right strength for this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This game is about the A and B drop targets and the hole awards. &nbsp;Shooting both &nbsp;the A and B targets scores 200, raises the center post, and increases the hole value. &nbsp;The targets then reset for you to repeat this. &nbsp;Continue to hit the A and B to keep getting those 200&rsquo;s and raising the hole value. &nbsp;Collect the hole when you feel its high enough; hole value goes 50-100-200-300-400-500. &nbsp;Hole values above 50 reset down to 50 after being collected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You may be able to repeatedly flip into the hole, let the kickout settle back on the left flipper-center post point, then flip it from there back into the hole. &nbsp;If the ball settles back on the right hand side, you may be able to microflip it back to the left for the repeat shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On some units, a full power flip from the post-cradle may be too strong and be rejected at the hole. &nbsp;Try a medium-level flip rather than a full one or a soft tapping one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even though there&rsquo;s a left gate kickback, and a ball going into the left gate when &nbsp;open should score 400 points by the time it&rsquo;s kicked back out, keep the ball away from there. &nbsp;Sometimes the kicker misses or kicks too weakly to pop the ball back into play.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center target scores 100 and advances the hole value, but I avoid it unless I have the post up and either also have the right gate open or else have the ball cradled and my shot is at it while it&rsquo;s lit to open that right gate. &nbsp;Otherwise, it&rsquo;s a rebound risk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shots to the top usually come back to the bottom on a flipper or hit the slings; side drains from up top are at highest risk when the ball is rolling down the right side of the back of the moving target section.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Flipper techniques: &nbsp;when you get the ball between the upraised post and a flipper tip, microflipping to transfer it to the other flipper is more difficult than on other games with this opportunity. &nbsp;As you try to creep up your microflip to &ldquo;just enough to transfer the ball,&rdquo; the flippers on Gay 90&rsquo;s tend to go nothing-nothing-nothing-too much. &nbsp;This can lead to a flip straight out the right drain from the left flipper or an uncontrolled shot off the left wall from the right flipper. &nbsp;Be careful!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Gemini [SS - Gottlieb, 1978]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;Complete the four colored lanes, then drop targets all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Skill shot: &nbsp;collect the yellow or red top lane; yellow is easier via soft plunging.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Base bonus is advanced by all top lanes, return lanes, outlanes and stand-up targets and goes up to 19K. &nbsp;Drop targets are worth 1000 plus 1000 for each of the four colors you&rsquo;ve collected; it&rsquo;s similar to Jacks to Open in that regard. &nbsp;Completing the red or yellow lanes gives you both colors. &nbsp;There are two places to collect each color: &nbsp;one top lane for each; the upper left side lanes for red and white; the upper right stand-up target for green; and the center right side lane is your second yellow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To double your bonus, complete all 8 drop targets. &nbsp;Complete them a second time to raise your multiplier to 3X. &nbsp;On ball 3, you start at 2X.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy is simple - - get the lanes first to maximize target value, then smack the targets all day to double and triple your bonus. &nbsp;Once at 3X and 19K, just keep smacking the drop targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If extra balls are on, completing all four colors lights the left outlane to score the extra ball.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Genie [SS - Gottlieb, 1979]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Shoot any lit drop target in the four-bank above the right flipper, otherwise UTAD through the left side or center spinner. &nbsp;If the ball gets near the left bumper, try to nudge it out to the center of the playfield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Genie was a better game when first released than it is now. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve only played one Genie in the past decade that played fast and clean; the others were slow and tedious, set shallow to attempt to offset weak flippers. &nbsp;Most Genies&rsquo; flippers are no longer able to zip the ball around the game adequately. &nbsp;In one case, a wise tournament director replaced the metal pinball with a lighter ceramic one, which made the game play roughly as it originally did. &nbsp;My description of how to play Genie here will presume you have tolerable but not great flipper power.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is important on Genie. &nbsp;Hitting any drop target in the 4-bank above the right flipper will increase your bonus multiplier when the bank is lit. &nbsp;It cycles on switches, so if it&rsquo;s not lit, go up top through either the center spinner from the left flipper or your choice of spinner or towards the upper playfield from the right flipper. &nbsp;If the spinner is lit, take it from either flipper, but remember getting your bonus X is more important if both the spinner and the drop target bank are lit. &nbsp;Most Genie spinners don&rsquo;t give a lot of spins per shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Genie is yet another Gottlieb game with a collect bonus saucer that activates automatically once your base bonus reaches 20,000. &nbsp;As with the other such games, you&rsquo;re better off not collecting it unless your bonus multiplier is 4X or 5X; if you&rsquo;re below that, work on raising the multiplier first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When you have the ball in the upper left mini-playfield, try to finish one color set, either red [4 drops] or white [3 drops]. &nbsp;Getting a set scores 10,000 and lights the white targets to be worth more &ndash; as the playfield says, 5000 and 3 bonus advances. &nbsp;In my experience, though, most Genies&rsquo; upper flippers are too weak to allow you much ball control or the ability to aim precisely, so do what you can to just keep the ball up there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ignore all standup targets. &nbsp;Also try to avoid the A-B-C-D lanes at the lower left. &nbsp;If the ball does go over there, try to get the ball to exit to the center of the playfield rather than down the 50-50 drain lane below the bumper. &nbsp;If it does go down there, you&rsquo;ll need some precise nudging to save the ball. &nbsp;Remember when doing so that you&rsquo;re nudging the machine under the ball, not the ball! &nbsp;Nudge from the right, but timing is critical.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Plunge is largely irrelevant, since all lanes score the same, but I like the A since the ball sometimes bounces off the bumper towards the upper left mini-playfield.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Gigi [EM - Gottlieb, 1963]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD;

100 for one set, 200 for 2 sets, 300 for 3 or more sets. &nbsp;Bumpers reset each ball; 6 out of 7 of each color on all five balls gets you zero bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy is super simple: &nbsp;thread the needle between the 2-3, 3-4, 4-5 or 5-6 red bumpers as often as you can and nudge for maximum bumper action before the ball falls back down. &nbsp;Ignore the 5 green rollovers. &nbsp;When the ball is up top, try to get some hits on the stand-up targets above the yellow #2 and #6 bumpers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Draining &ldquo;correctly&rdquo; is important; the outlanes score 100, the center nada. &nbsp;You can win or lose a game with side drains.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;the rolls out of the two side lanes.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Gold Rush [EM - Williams, 1971]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Line up matching symbols on the reels, then shoot the center collect saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This game and it&rsquo;s sibling, the single-player Klondike, are very similar to Yukon. &nbsp;The difference is that these have a center saucer, a bumper blocking easy access to the top reels from the flippers, no return lanes, and a center post. &nbsp;Yukon has return lanes, no center saucer, no center bumper and no center post. &nbsp;Gold Rush often has one extra nuance: &nbsp;like doodle Bug, the ball can drain between the flippers and the bottom of the slingshots. &nbsp;This means exercising caution when trying to catch the ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The scoring is somewhat obscure since it&rsquo;s based on how well your slot machine reels at the top match up. &nbsp;With mixed reel symbols, e.g. three different or two of one and one of another, collecting the reel value scores 500. &nbsp;When there are three of the same symbol showing, the reel value goes up. &nbsp;A &ldquo;wagon&rdquo; serves as a wild card. &nbsp;Three hats or two hat plus a wagon is worth 3000. &nbsp;Three pans or two pans plus a wagon is worth 4000. &nbsp;Three lanterns or two lanterns plus a wagon is worth 5000 plus an extra ball if enabled. &nbsp;Three wagons is worth 5000 (and two extra balls if enabled).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are seven places to score the reel value: &nbsp;both top lanes, both top saucers, both outlanes and the center saucer. &nbsp;The top two saucers also each light a pair of bumpers when collected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hitting any reel advances it, with the reel moving top-forwards towards the player. &nbsp;Reels are also advanced by the top rollover buttons and mid-playfield standup targets (left and right) and by the two side lanes (center reel). &nbsp;The side lanes also raise your center post; a rollover button at the bottom lowers the post.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The current reel value is preserved when a new game is started. &nbsp;If you begin a game with it lit for more than 500 points, try to soft plunge for the score reel lane at the top right without hitting the advance reel rollover above it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center post is raised by going through either of the two side lanes that advance the center reel. &nbsp;A small rollover button a few inches above the post lowers it. &nbsp;As with any center post, if it&rsquo;s up, don&rsquo;t flip; use it to get control of the ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy is somewhat UTAD unless the reels are lined up for increased value. &nbsp;If they&rsquo;re at high value, try to keep collecting the reel value at the center saucer without changing them. &nbsp;If you see a good lineup available if you change a reel, try to advance the appropriate reel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Both Gold Rush and Klondike suffer from &ldquo;block-itis&rdquo; by which I mean many of the things you might want to hit cannot be shot directly from the flippers. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t hit either upper saucer to collect the reel value and light the bumpers other than through a bank shot or help from the bumpers. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t hit the advance reel targets at the top without bumper help even though these are safer than hitting the targets lower down. &nbsp;And one last indignity, that collect reel value saucer in the center, the only one you can shoot directly? &nbsp;The saucer is shallow enough that shots at it often skip right through it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Gold Strike [EM - Gottlieb, 1975]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c9">Quickie Version: &nbsp;</span><span class="c17 c5 c9">Lit</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;drop targets all day; they&rsquo;re worth 10 times unlit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Gold Strike is the add-a-ball version of El Dorado, with slightly different rules.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Drop targets galore. &nbsp;Shoot the lit ones for 5,000, unlit ones are only 500. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a good amount of strategy and ball control required to get the most out the target banks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The drop target lights are synchronized. &nbsp;At all times, exactly three positions will be lit, e.g. the top horse on the lower 5-bank, the left-most cactus on the upper 10-bank and the 6th target from the right on the upper bank. &nbsp;Hitting the center star rollover moves the trio one position to the right (and scores 1,000).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The A-B-C lanes each light one of the upper right lanes above the top bumper for 5000: &nbsp;A the left one, B the center, C the right lane. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a good idea to try to get all three lanes lit. &nbsp;Completing all three lights the standup targets. &nbsp;Unlike El Dorado, the A-B-C lanes themselves are never worth 5000, they&rsquo;re just 1000 at all times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key Feeds: &nbsp;watch the three feeds on this machine carefully! &nbsp;When the ball comes down the left lane into the left bumper [feed 1], does it tend to come to the left, meaning either a drain out the left or a feed the left return lane, or come out the right, to either the left flipper or down the center? &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll need to be nudging either way but check its natural tendencies first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When the ball comes down the right side, it can be moving slow if it fell through the left of the two lanes [feed 2] and hits the right wall or rattles unevenly down the right lane, or it can be moving faster if it falls cleanly down the right lane [feed 3]. &nbsp;Again, where does each tend to go? &nbsp;If the clean fall comes out fast enough to reach the left flipper, don&rsquo;t nudge. &nbsp;If the slow fall comes out and thinks about slipping to the right towards the inlane/outlane divider, nudge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The drop targets on the right are rarely backhandable, but you can often do a &ldquo;well-timed-flying-backhand&rdquo; into them when the ball is coming to the right flipper. &nbsp;If it looks like the ball is headed that way in such a manner that you&rsquo;re not likely to be able to trap it on the flipper, give this a try.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Also unlike El Dorado, the return lanes and outlanes when lit score only 1000, not 5000. &nbsp;With neither the ABC nor the return lanes going up to high value, the importance of shooting the lit drop targets and getting the upper right lanes lit and scored is even higher than on El Dorado.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Further complicating your task is what happens when you complete both target banks. &nbsp;You get 5000 for doing so, but at that point, the value of hitting a lit drop target changes to scoring an extra ball. &nbsp;Unless extra balls have been set to award points instead, that makes them useless to you and means no drop targets are worth more than 500 points for the rest of that ball, when the extra ball feature resets.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Golden Arrow [EM &ndash; Gottlieb, 1977]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;Shoot lit numbers and lanes, ideally with both the number and the arrow lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A pretty poor game for competition, since once you&rsquo;ve collected all the numbers, there&rsquo;s almost nothing to do but chase the sole lit arrow if able or go UTAD and hope for bumper love and some random hits on the 5K green stand-up targets. &nbsp;Having the lit arrow where you can use it is more a matter of luck than skill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Numbers score 5000 when lit, which is just the first time collected; they&rsquo;re worth only 500 thereafter. &nbsp;The two spinners and the star rollover in the center move the arrow which is always on exactly one number. &nbsp;If both the number and the arrow on it are lit, it scores 10K. &nbsp;Blue bumpers score 1K.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Gorgar [SS - Williams, 1979]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;complete the drop target banks, then shoot the upper left &ldquo;snake pit&rdquo; alcove. &nbsp;Get A-B-C to light the spinner, shoot that from the left. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re good at shatzing, you can also elect to shatz the return lanes all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Ah, the first talkie. &nbsp;It has a different layout than its predecessors, too. &nbsp;A fun game if played the way the designers intended, but it can be boring at the expert level, where the optimal technique changes.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Normal&rdquo; play is to shoot the center drop targets from either flipper and the top left ones from the right flipper to advance the snake pit to its maximum value of 50,000 and advance your bonus along the way. &nbsp;Some left flipper shots should be through the spinner to go up top to collect the A-B-C lanes to increase your bonus multiplier to 2x and then 3X. &nbsp;The spinner lights when you advance your bonus to 10K, at which point spinner shots become more valuable. &nbsp;Once your bonus reaches 20K, the spinner turns back off! &nbsp;You thus have a limited window for lit spinner shots.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">You can also advance the snake pit by making the 1-2-3-4 standup targets in order. &nbsp;I wouldn&rsquo;t try shooting at them directly, due to rebound risk, but if you&rsquo;ve collected 1-2-3 in order, go ahead and shoot #4 [see below].</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">If you&rsquo;re good at shatzing, the other strategy is to cross-shatz all day to build up your bonus to maximum and light the snake pit for 50,000 as well. &nbsp;Each bottom lane scores 3K and adds one bonus; shoot one or both of them enough and you can max out your base bonus. &nbsp;Getting one of </span><span class="c17 c5">each</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;lane gives you a 1-2-3-4 number. &nbsp;Since finishing 1-2-3-4 lights the snake pit for the maximum value of 50K, if you shatz both sides, not just one, and do so four times each, you&rsquo;ll get 24K regular points, plus base bonus raised from 1K to 9K, plus have the snake pit lit for a 50K shot. &nbsp;Take that 50K shot and repeat the process. &nbsp;But watch out for inlane-outlane drains while shatzing if you shoot too hard.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Even if you don&rsquo;t finish getting 1-2-3-4 via shatzing, making progress on it gives you a chance to finish it with a normal standup target shot, e.g. if you get three pairs of D-E lanes shatzes, you just need to hit the &ldquo;4&rdquo; standup to light the snake pit.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Maximum bonus is base of 29K and multiplier of 3X for 87,000.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Granada [EM - Williams, 1972]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Choice of UTAD or shatz-all-day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Visually like Spanish Eyes [especially the backglass], but with a noticeably different playfield. &nbsp;Like Spanish Eyes, meant to be played with extra balls ON. &nbsp;And not much fun to play if the bumpers are weak.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are two ways to earn EBs on the game: &nbsp;one via the G-R-A-N-A-D-A letter lanes, the other via the numbered 1-10 standup targets. &nbsp;Finish either and then hit the corresponding special target in the center to get your extra ball. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;ve finished both, hit the center special for two extra balls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bumper strength is important since most of the numbers and letters on the game cannot be shot directly from either flipper. &nbsp;Most must be bounced into by the bumpers. &nbsp;If the bumpers are strong, shots up top will get you a couple of the numbers and maybe an up-the-top-lane letter or two. &nbsp;If they&rsquo;re weak &hellip; you&rsquo;ll wish you weren&rsquo;t playing the game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Like Spanish Eyes, you get a 5000 point feature lit when you complete things, in this case, the left saucer for the letters and the right saucer for the numbers. &nbsp;Otherwise, most of your points come from bumper action up top - - the bumpers themselves, each target or lane you score, and the 500-point gate between the lower pair of bumpers. &nbsp;The two return lanes score 5000 each, big on this game, so since the return lanes are shatzable, learn to do it. &nbsp;In fact, if the bumpers are so-so and the shatz shot exit from the return lanes is safe, consider a shatz-all-day strategy - - boring but effective.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Grand Prix [EM - Williams, 1976]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Semi-UTAD through either spinner; nudge balls coming out of the top saucer to hit the bumpers and rebound into the A and B drop targets to light double bonus. &nbsp;Collect bonus at the saucers when lit for double maximum bonus [2X50K]. &nbsp;Resume UTAD and collect bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Shots to master: &nbsp;Both spinners.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is one of many top players&rsquo; favorite EMs, even though it&rsquo;s largely a UTAD spinner-all-day game. &nbsp;Skill Shot is to get the ball in the top saucer for 5K and a bonus advance. &nbsp;The ball will kick out towards the right bumper. &nbsp;You want to nudge to try to get the ball to knock down the A and B targets above and outside the bumpers. &nbsp;A+B lights double bonus. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re at a lower-level tournament or league where extra balls are on, getting A+B twice lights a return lane for an EB, three times awards the EB outright. &nbsp;If EBs are off, ignore the A and B targets once you have double bonus lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While the top saucer and the two middle-of-the-sides mini-slings below the side bonus-collect saucers each gives a bonus advance, the best way to advance the bonus is to shoot the spinners. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a second reason to do so: &nbsp;once the bonus for a side is maxed out at 50K [100K if doubled], the spinner value jumps from 100 per spin to 1,000 per spin. &nbsp;Most Grand Prixes have pretty active spinners, so this can be worth 20-30K per shot once lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When you collect bonus on either side, that side&rsquo;s spinner reverts to the 100-per-spin value. &nbsp;You can rebuild the bonus, of course, and collect it many times per ball. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s look at the math, though. &nbsp;Every 5 spins advance the bonus by one notch of 5,000. &nbsp;Thus, it takes 50 spins to max out the bonus at 50K. &nbsp;50 spins when the spinner is lit is also worth 50K. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s nothing to be gained by collecting an undoubled bonus vs. continuing to shoot the spinner. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When you have double bonus lit, though, collect it whenever you can and then go back to the spinners to refill it. &nbsp;Your 50 spins to refill the bonus are worth 100K in this case, assuming you either eventually collect that side saucer or that side&rsquo;s arrow is lit when the ball drains - - the end-of-ball collect bonus applies to whichever side&rsquo;s arrow is lit at the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball control: &nbsp;use dead bounce passes a lot. &nbsp;[See video of Circuit Final.] &nbsp;Less-than-perfect live catches tend to roll up the flipper and drain out the gaps above the return lanes. &nbsp;Shatz passes are clearly impractical for the same reason, and post passes aren&rsquo;t really necessary, just shoot either spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Note to TDs: &nbsp;this game has a tendency to &ldquo;skip&rdquo; 100,000&rsquo;s either when counting down side bonus collects or making a really zippy spinner shot. &nbsp;Check to make sure the scoring reels advance properly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;kickouts from the collect bonus side saucers. &nbsp;Can you let them dead bounce safely or not?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Grand Slam [EM - Gottlieb, 1972]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;doubles and triples on the upper sides all day unless you have the bases loaded, then go for the home run shot at the stand-up targets above the double and triple.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Not much to this game, unfortunately. &nbsp;Skill Shot is a home run lane at the top, of course. &nbsp;Your best points are if you load the bases and then get a home run, worth 5000, via either of the two standup targets to the outside of the two bumpers. &nbsp;But it&rsquo;s not likely you&rsquo;ll deliberately load the bases. &nbsp;The first, second and third base saucers all score 1000 and put a player on that base, but they tend to deflect the ball a lot - - shooting at them is more likely to not go in but have the ball arc out of control after rimming out of the saucer. &nbsp;Besides the saucers, you could load the bases with three singles if you do so without scoring other hits that drive in runs baseball-style. &nbsp;Again, this is not that likely, even if you&rsquo;re a good shot, since rebounds can go down the double or triple side lanes, or into the bumpers and then up top or into a random roto target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I just try to shoot the double and triple on the sides and if the ball settles into the saucer, fine. &nbsp;If I make the double or triple, the ball will continue up to bounce around the bumpers and maybe then go up top for a hit and some lane points or else hit one of those two standups. &nbsp;If I do get the bases loaded, yes, I&rsquo;ll try not to get a hit other than a single until I can take a shot at the home run. &nbsp;The single targets above the double and triple lanes change to home run targets when the bases are loaded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The outlanes are both home runs, so if you have the bases loaded and drain through one of them, at least you&rsquo;ll cash in for 5000 points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The roto-target at the top can give either points or a single, double, etc. &nbsp;I avoid it due to rebound center drain risk.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Grand Slam [SS - Bally, 1983]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Shoot the &ldquo;single&rdquo;

you&rsquo;ll get a shot, but since the flipper is backwards, you&rsquo;ll need to pay close attention to hit it since your natural reflexes tend to miss. &nbsp;Shots from this upper flipper are the only way to get the ball back to the top lanes, so it&rsquo;s important to learn to make this shot!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing the standup targets and lanes for STEAL advances your bonus multiplier to 2X, then 3X;

The scoring difference between Gridiron and Pro Football is in the values of the spinner and the lanes. &nbsp;The two top outer lanes on Gridiron are worth 1000 when lit; the two central lanes are worth 3000 lit; and the inner lanes and the side lanes below the outer top lanes are worth 5000 when lit. &nbsp;On Pro Football, the scores are only one tenth of these, while the vari-target and bumper values are the same. &nbsp;On Gridiron, this makes it better to avoid the vari-target risk and just go UTAD via the spinner, which at 1000 is also 10 times Pro Football&rsquo;s value.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As on Pro Football, the vari-targets score more the further back you push them; which flipper, upper or lower, does that better is a bit more variable from machine to machine. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s also affected by how steep or shallow the game is. &nbsp;This is a case where you may need to have the ball rolling down the flipper face to add that extra bit of energy to the shot to push the vari-target all the way back. &nbsp;Vari-target values range from 1000 to 5000; you also get a touchdown for a fully-back hit, but partially-back shots do not award yards as on Pro Football.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Touchdowns are scored every 100 yards and award 6000 points. &nbsp;The lanes and spinner spot you yards towards that. &nbsp;Side drains score a touchdown. &nbsp;With the top lanes and spinner worth so much, though, you can pretty much ignore touchdowns.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The upper flippers of each pair are better for getting the ball up top into the bumper and lane zone when you can&rsquo;t set up a spinner shot. &nbsp;The paired flippers take some getting used to since they&rsquo;re at different angles with the upper ones at a steeper angle and the lower ones shallower.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Gulfstream [EM - Williams, 1973]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;shoot the center target to get three numbers in a row and shoot to collect of the all lettered lanes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I played the add-a-ball version of this, Tropic Fun, a lot in college. &nbsp;Since I was in a snowy climate, the tropical artwork welcome. &nbsp;There are two themes to this game, completing the lettered lanes and the center target. &nbsp;The center target scores one of the 1-9 targets, whichever is lit on the playfield below it at the time. &nbsp;Hundred point switches change the lit number.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The key here is to get either three number in a row or all four corner numbers.

(towards you) the lower left flipper towards the bumper. &nbsp;The center hole / saucer kicks the ball out downwards on the main playfield. &nbsp;The right hole / saucer kicks the ball up and to the right onto the left side of the upper playfield towards the left flipper. &nbsp;Balls can go between the main and the upper playfield via the ramp on the right. &nbsp;Balls can go from the upper to the lower playfield via the hole on the left side of the upper; these land near the lower left flipper. &nbsp;Balls exiting the lower playfield are always popped to the main playfield through the scoop just below and right of the top left plunger holes; they usually are thrown towards the upper of the two flippers on the main playfield left. &nbsp;Balls can enter the lower playfield from the main one via the top left plunger hole, by going through the hole behind the center push-back target, and by shooting the &ldquo;trap door&rdquo; shot on the far right. &nbsp;From the center hole, the ball lands just above the lower left flipper. &nbsp;From the trap door, the ball is kicked out over the lower right flipper going left across the playfield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The flippers require getting used to. &nbsp;The upper and lower playfield flippers are not reversed, but it sometimes seems like it. &nbsp;The upper &ldquo;right&rdquo; flipper faces the way a left flipper normally does and vice versa. &nbsp;The lower playfield flippers aren&rsquo;t reversed in terms of where they are visually either, right being right, but are reversed if you think in terms of which flipper it is if you were &ldquo;facing&rdquo; the lower playfield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To activate both the upper and lower flippers, you need to use the set of flipper buttons slightly further back on the cabinet than the regular buttons. &nbsp;When the ball changes playfields to or from the main playfield in either direction, you&rsquo;ll have to quickly switch which set of buttons you use!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On the main playfield, there&rsquo;s a small drain area between the two flippers on the right; beware!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing a set of drop targets in either the lower or upper playfield activates double scoring on the opposite playfield. &nbsp;Completing them a second time activates double scoring on the main playfield. &nbsp;(How&rsquo;s that for convoluted?) &nbsp;If you do enough work in the top or bottom, the other two playfields will both be worth double. &nbsp;Completing the lower playfield drops seems to be the easier of the two.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Each visit to the upper or lower playfield raises your &ldquo;monster bonus&rdquo; multiplier, up to 5X. &nbsp;Monster bonus is earned on just these two playfields by hitting the drop targets and the lower standup targets. &nbsp;If you plunge to the upper playfield and the ball exits it out the left to the lower playfield rather than out the right via the ramp to the main, your bonus multiplier will already be at 3X.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Points are primarily earned by hitting the targets on all three playfield &ndash; drops upper and lower, standups on the main. &nbsp;Strategy is to keep going upstairs and downstairs as much as you can and smacking the heck out of the targets while there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lastly, the game tends to play slow unless the operator has consciously steepened it and is notorious for having maintenance issues. &nbsp;Fun, but a risk to use in competition due to its reliability.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Hearts and Spades [EM - Gottlieb, 1969]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the add-a-ball version of Spin-A-Card with different scoring and a slightly different strategy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hearts and Spades is a great EM if you&rsquo;re playing to win extra balls. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re playing for points, it loses a whole lot in translation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill shot: &nbsp;soft plunge to make the far right lane to light the yellow bumpers; the far left is okay, too, but soft plunging the right is easier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hearts and Spades has a different point value ratio mix than its free-game sibling, Spin-A-Card. &nbsp;On Spin-A-Card, the points ratios, using lit bumpers as the base, are: &nbsp;bumpers 1; targets 10; saucers 20; and top center lane 50. &nbsp;On Hearts and Spades, the ratios are: &nbsp;bumpers 1; targets 5; fan target, saucers and top lane 10 each. &nbsp;As a result, the relative value of the bumpers makes lighting them more useful than trying for the center lane on the skill shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As on Spin-A-Card, the two &ldquo;spin&rdquo; saucers are too small to make shooting at them practical since the ball must usually be moving slowly to fall into them. &nbsp;Your best chance of having the ball go in a saucer is via nudging as the ball is coming down from the top near one of them. &nbsp;Besides points, they spot a random card. &nbsp;The saucers eject the ball upwards at an angle between the bumper and the center triangle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The yellow bumpers are lit by the top right lane and the middle side right lane; the green bumpers are lit by the counterpart lanes on the left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center fan-shaped target is worth 1000 unless you&rsquo;ve completed all ten cards, when it becomes worth an extra ball for the remainder of the ball in play. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s the attraction of the add-a-ball version, trying to get all ten cards and then getting as many extra balls from the center target as you can before draining.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The strategy on the game is UTAD; aim your shots to either side of the two saucers, trying to slip past or just barely graze the bumpers above them so the ball continues on upwards. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t want to hit those bumpers head on, the rebounds can drain. &nbsp;With any luck, the ball will eventually come down one of the side lanes to light the bumpers. &nbsp;Just keep sending it up top. &nbsp;Do not shoot at the center fan target, nor at the #2 or King standup targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Try shatzing the ball up the opposite return lane to see what happens. &nbsp;If the ball consistently goes up just enough to score it but not so much that you get an up-and-out drain, consider a cross-shatz all day strategy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While a bit of a luck box as far as getting action while the ball is up top, the game does require and reward skill for being able to thread the needle on shots to get to the top.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Heat Wave [EM - Williams, 1964]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD if the flippers are strong. &nbsp;If the flippers are weak, shoot the A and B targets until the center target value is 400 or 500, shoot the target, then shoot A and B again to reset the target and repeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">There are only two sources of good points on this machine: &nbsp;the top bumper, worth 100 when lit, and the center drop target. &nbsp;The value of the drop target starts at 100 and is raised up to 500 in 100-point increments via nine items: &nbsp;the five rollover buttons at the top, when lit;

way easier said than done on this machine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The flipper positions relative to the center drain area are not what you&rsquo;re used to: a wide space between the flippers with an up-facing triangular wedge between them. &nbsp;Balls that hit the sides of the wedge will bounce towards the flippers, but it&rsquo;s a real challenge to learn when to flip at those bounces right away vs. not flip and try to cradle the ball. &nbsp;If the ball bounces too hard towards the flipper and you don&rsquo;t flip, it may continue up into the slingshot and get kicked away. &nbsp;If you have a chance to practice on the game, test this out.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Hercules [SS &ndash;

right-to-left orbit shot to advance and collect them. &nbsp;After that, I return to right flipper up top shots except for hitting the bonus pad advance targets as mentioned below.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Base bonus goes up to 49K, but you have to hit one of the large pad stand-up targets to move beyond each 10K level. &nbsp;Once at 10K, hit the pad to the left of the right orbit. &nbsp;You can then move on from 10K to 20K. &nbsp;At 20K, hit the pad left of the bumpers. &nbsp;At 30K, hit the pad right of the right orbit. &nbsp;At 40K, hit the pad left of the left orbit. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is earned for each lane or pad target scored. &nbsp;Double bonus is a three-step approach. &nbsp;First, score the top left lane to &ldquo;start&rdquo; double bonus earning. &nbsp;Step two, score either that lane again or a path of victory orbit shot with the now-lit advance double bonus light. &nbsp;Your progress is shown in the center of the playfield with the yellow lights under Double Bonus. &nbsp;Get three lights to ready the double bonus shot. &nbsp;Step three is to shoot a path of victory shot to earn double bonus. &nbsp;Base bonus is held from ball to ball, but double bonus resets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If extra balls or specials are on, which they usually are, you earn them similar to double bonus, first by making the top lane to start them, then getting that lane again or the right orbit to advance them. &nbsp;You need five total for extra ball, six for special, and again the shot to complete it must be the path of victory. &nbsp;A path of victory shot advances all features for which you have made the top lane on that ball in play. &nbsp;If you make shots up top to collect the two lanes you didn&rsquo;t score on the plunge, each subsequent path shot will advance double bonus, extra ball and special for the rest of the ball. &nbsp;You can even finish more than one of them on the same path shot if more than one is ready.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The game plays extremely slowly; so slowly, you&rsquo;ll be able to see the spin on the ball as you play. &nbsp;And spin it does; the spin sometimes affects your shots. &nbsp;The flippers are hand-sized and somewhat sloppy, though you can shatz-pass the ball with them. &nbsp;If the flippers are weak, attempted path of victory shots may not go all the way around but drop into the bumpers after going halfway. &nbsp;Any switch hit between the star rollovers in the right orbit and left orbit negates it counting as a path of victory shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Assuming the flippers are in decent condition, it&rsquo;s easy to regain control of the ball after a path of victory shot via loop passing: &nbsp;use the left flipper to deflect the ball to the right return lane to set up a cradle and a shot up top. &nbsp;For a strong left flipper, it&rsquo;s a standard hold-and-drop loop pass, easy to perform at the slow ball speeds here. &nbsp;For a medium-strength flipper, just hold the flipper up and the flipper will sag enough when the ball comes back to it to deflect into the return lane.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Hi Lo Ace [EM - Bally, 1973] &nbsp;

finishing 8 through Ace lights alternate middle gate lanes for Special. &nbsp;When the middle gate special is lit, you want to get the NON-special gate lane for 5000. &nbsp;The only other ways to add meaningful points at that stage are by hitting the three risky button standup targets in the middle of the game, or getting the ball to go up the Ace lane;

officially, it&rsquo;s on an &ldquo;adjustable mystery basis&rdquo;]. &nbsp;General strategy is UTAD through either the spinner or the double bonus orbit [even if not lit] until your bonus is maxed at 15K and doubled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once your bonus is at 30K, it&rsquo;s time to deal with the five cards [pun intended]. Each card standup target scores 1K and increases the value of the center saucer. If you&rsquo;ve got three or four of the cards completed, you can then consider taking shots at that center saucer. &nbsp;I still wouldn&rsquo;t, though; the saucer is high-risk / high-reward, giving 1000 per card plus one bonus advance per card, but if you miss it and hit one of the posts next to the saucer instead, you can easily drain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you do manage to complete all five cards, forget about everything but the left side spinner. &nbsp;The spinner is now worth 1000 per spin, which beats anything else on the playfield for risk-reward when lit. &nbsp;This is true even if you light the spinner before maxing out your bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the Hang Glider version of this playfield, the card-themed standup targets are changed into kite-themed drop targets. &nbsp;Scoring and strategy are otherwise the same.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">High Hand [EM - Gottlieb, 1973]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;finish complete sets of card suit drop targets, then center saucer all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot &ndash; make the lit top lane for 1000; the ball should then hit the 1000 bumper and rebound off it into either the Ace of Spades [right] or the Jack of Diamonds [left], spotting you a card.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Goal &ndash; complete suits to advance bonus value; bonus is 100 for one card in a suit, 200 for two cards, 300 for three cards, then leaps to 4000 for a complete suit. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy &ndash; try to finish suits rather than get some of each: &nbsp;12 cards total with 3 in each suit is worth 1,200 in bonus; 12 cards total in three [complete] suits is worth 12,000 in bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shot choice &ndash; from a cradle, shoot the upper suits [diamonds and spades]; you can backhand the Q-J of diamonds and A-K of spades. &nbsp;All but the diamond jack and spade ace can be cross-shot. &nbsp;When the ball is rolling down the inlane towards a flipper too slowly to transfer across, shoot the lower suits [clubs and hearts]. &nbsp;The top suits can be drainy when cross-shooting, so be alert. &nbsp;The top edge cards are restively safe if you hit them on the outer edges.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus &ndash; collected ONLY at the saucer or side outlanes. &nbsp;Center drains do not score bonus! &nbsp;There are several shots to collect bonus at the saucer, none of which are high percentage. &nbsp;Which work best will vary from machine to machine depending on flipper power, machine slope and slingshot power. &nbsp;Shot 1 is direct into the saucer, but this must be very precise to avoid rim-out; try to feather the flipper a bit. &nbsp;Shot 2 is towards the gaps next to the ace of diamonds or jack of spades: &nbsp;when the ball falls back, you can sometimes nudge the bounce off the angled middle lane guide into the straight guide and then into the saucer [or directly off the edge of the angled guide]. &nbsp;Shot 3 is to bank the ball off the opposite slingshot, which angles it towards the saucer but moving more slowly than a direct shot: &nbsp;less accurate, but less likely to rim out when not precise, and less likely to drain if you miss.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">The main thing on High Hand is to have the ball going </span><span class="c17 c5">slowly</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c17 c5">not straight up-and-down</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;in the vicinity of the hole. The Gottlieb saucers are steep-edged, which means that a ball entering one close to center-on is more likely to actually fall in than is true for a shallower bowl-shaped saucer like those on many Ballys [Little Chief, or the more common SS games like Paragon and Mata Hari]. &nbsp;Slower helps because, like a golf hole, a too-hard shot will rim out unless dead center, while a slower shot can fall in from the edge. Coming in from the side is better because if it does miss, fall short or rim out, it&rsquo;s less likely to drain down the middle. &nbsp;The highest percentage is the rattle-out-of-the-angled-lane nudge-in, made via shooting up top, but that&#39;s indirect. &nbsp;Next highest is the sling bank shot; the advantage here is it both slows the ball since the sling kicks either not at all or weakly at the proper shot angle, and that if it misses, the ball can continue higher up and turn into one of those lane rattle-out-and-ins - - while the shot itself isn&#39;t the highest percentage, it gives you two chances which total your best odds. There one more indirect way, a bank shot off the tip of those angled lane sides, but that&#39;s a really fine angle, although a close miss again gives you a chance at a rattler. &nbsp;The direct shot actually has a better chance to go in when the flippers are weak, but of course then, it&rsquo;s harder to finish the top cards.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Hit the Deck [SS - Gottlieb, 1978]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the replay version of the more-often-seen Neptune.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;get a card you need;

Once you have a pair, e.g. two jacks, the value of one of the pair will go up from 500 to 5000 (it alternates).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The game is pretty much UTAD and nudging to get a complete set of one or both card colors. &nbsp;I prefer to shoot straight up towards the gap between the center and left bumpers and assume the ball will start bouncing around between the top lanes, the bumper, the top saucer and the left chute. &nbsp;I only shoot at the Queen and King standup targets at the lower left if they&rsquo;re the only cards I still need.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Because very few cards can be shot at directly, and those few can be dangerous, you&rsquo;ll find yourself shooting near the bumpers often. &nbsp;Be very careful not to hit the bottom of any bumper squarely, as this can rebound to drain.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Hi-Flyer [EM - Chicago Coin, 1974]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD until your bonus is maxxed, then spinner all day once that&rsquo;s lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the 2-player version of Sky Rider.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;try to hit the two rollover &ldquo;advance&rdquo;

scoring one on either side advances both sides. &nbsp;Rollovers reset each ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The side slingshots raise the center post; the rollover button right above the post lowers it, so balls coming almost straight down the middle will drain despite your post when it gets lowered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If extra balls are on, you get them by completing the 1-5 rollovers three times, then shooting the saucer by them. &nbsp;Only one saucer is lit at a time, alternating on 10-point switches. &nbsp;Saucer value stays at 5K for your extra ball, then resets at the end of that ball. &nbsp;You cannot earn an extra ball during one.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Hot Hand [SS - Stern, 1979]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c9">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Hit the drop targets, Ace first, from the left flipper;

on ball one, try for the Jack right where the ball comes into play. &nbsp;Since the arm moves counterclockwise, it may then knock the ball into one of the saucers left of that to score another card. &nbsp;On balls two and three, try to land in the pocket for a card you don&rsquo;t already have. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll find the ball often rims out of the pockets without landing in them. &nbsp;A ball in a pocket will continue to score points until the arm knocks it out of the pocket.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is big here, with both base and multipliers built by cards. &nbsp;Each card is 1000 bonus &ndash; 5 cards, 4 suits, 20K total. &nbsp;Multipliers are earned by good poker hands: &nbsp;a pair for 2X, three of a kind for 3X, four of a kind for 4X, all twenty cards scored for 5X. &nbsp;If you get all twenty, that turns on your &ldquo;super bonus&rdquo;

finish the drop targets, then change suits to get a shot at a different Ace. &nbsp;You can get the non-Ace cards with drop targets, standup targets and the top pockets, but the Aces come only from that center drop target. &nbsp;If you knock down the Ace target when you already have the Ace of the lit suit, you have to both finish the target bank and change suits for a chance at a different Ace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Changing suits is part skill, part luck: &nbsp;the spinner, slingshots and bumpers all change it, but getting them to _stop_ changing it at the suit you need is chance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lighting the spinner is not as big a deal as on some games since it&rsquo;s already at 1000 per spin and lit just doubles it to 2K. &nbsp;You want to shoot it lit or not for both points and to get the ball up top for more cards in the pockets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once you have your bonus maxed out, just keep shooting the spinner and, if you can&rsquo;t transfer the ball to the right flipper, the drop targets. &nbsp;Ignore the &nbsp;standup targets completely.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Hot Line [EM - Williams, 1966]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c9">Quickie Version and full version: &nbsp;UTAD</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Try to shoot the ball up the sides of the games rather than between bumpers.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hot Shot [EM &ndash;

lane to light the up kicker and collect bonus lane. &nbsp;Very important! &nbsp;Even if you already have the K and need the S or I letters, still choose the K on the plunge for the kicker, then get the S and I later with shots to the top from the left flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Each lane, drop target and standup target gives you a different letter. &nbsp;Two of the return lanes also spot a letter at all times, two others do so when lit. &nbsp;Bonus is 2K per letter. &nbsp;Completing them all lights the 30K bonus light and lets you start a second set of letters. &nbsp;Bonus base value is held each ball. &nbsp;Bonus multiplier is advanced via the inline drop targets in the upper left: &nbsp;3X, 4X and 5X (there is no 2X); multiplier resets each ball. &nbsp;Maximum bonus is 57K base and 5X for 285K total. &nbsp;No, it&rsquo;s not 60K; &nbsp;if you complete all the letters again, they reset and you&rsquo;re back to just 30K base, so stop before you finish the second set. &nbsp;First inline target lights the spinner at the top right for 1K per spin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hotdoggin&rsquo;s unique feature is its &ldquo;disappearing kicker&rdquo; bonus collect. &nbsp;While there&rsquo;s no direct shot for the chute, if you have the kicker lit, you should try to nudge the ball in there, especially if you&rsquo;ve built up a large bonus. &nbsp;The kicker turns off once triggered and must be relit by getting the K lane at the top again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If the kicker is not lit, the ball will fall down through the chute towards the right outlane. &nbsp;The small pin below the chute can deflect the ball back into play towards the right return lanes. &nbsp;Any time the ball enters the chute without the kicker active, try to make sure it hits that pin as it exits with well-timed a slap to the right side of the game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Finishing S-K-I lights the S and I for 5K and raises one bumper value to 1K for each SKI completion. &nbsp;SKI + HOTDOGGIN raises the saucer value to 25K. &nbsp;Each bank of drop targets goes up in per-target value the first time completed. &nbsp;The DOGG letters are best shot from the extra upper right flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since you need all the letters, there&rsquo;s no short-cut strategy to a big score. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve got to spread your shots around. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s what makes this a good game, little is wasted.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Hulk, The Incredible [SS - Gottlieb, 1979]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Up Top until you have the 5X bonus multiplier and base bonus at 20K, then nudge for either collect bonus chute [&ldquo;A&rdquo;

a shot that doesn&rsquo;t make it all the way up top will often dribble back through the spinner and fall into the A chute for your collect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hitting the 1, 2 and 3 standup targets lights both the spinner on the left for 1000 and the lane at the middle right for an extra ball [if enabled]. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s possible to shoot the ball up it from the bottom of the EB lane, but most of the time you see it collected, it&rsquo;s via nudging it to enter from above.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The top right drop targets add bonus, but I shoot them mainly to try to get the ball to the top lanes. &nbsp;Once at 5X, they&rsquo;re useful for adding bonus, nothing else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball control on Hulk is unique, due to the tiny rubbers on the center sides of the chutes; these are not high-power slingshots, just rubbers, so rebounds off of them are more deflections than kicks. &nbsp;The outland angles are rude, too, since the inlane-outlane divider is about an inch lower than the entry point. &nbsp;This means most balls that enter cleanly are doomed to the outlane; it&rsquo;s gotta bounce around a bit to go into the return lane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;out of the middle right lane [should go to left flipper], and out of the spinner [into the A, but when it doesn&rsquo;t go in cleanly, nudge to a void a rattling-out center drain].</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Ice Fever [SS &ndash;

already-collected lanes are unlit and worth 500. &nbsp;Given a choice on the plunge, take one of the center ones since it&rsquo;s easier to get one of the side ones during game play.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">One you have at least two suits, go ahead and start shooting drop targets. &nbsp;Which ones to shoot, though, are actually the </span><span class="c17 c5">opposite</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of what the game&rsquo;s playfield suggests! &nbsp;You do get 5000 points for completing the next &ldquo;hand,&rdquo; e.g. the two jacks, then the three queens, then the kings-queens full house, then the royal flush, but you want to &ldquo;milk&rdquo; the target bank for a while before you complete it. &nbsp;Be careful once you&rsquo;ve shot some drops, though: &nbsp;it exposes bare rubber behind them. &nbsp;Shots into bare rubber, especially behind the center three drops, are more likely to drain than shots to the targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On this game, you need to think &ldquo;flow&rdquo; and &ldquo;dead bounce&rdquo; a lot. &nbsp;When the ball rolls down a return lane, it will be going too slow to transfer across, but may also be too fast to cradle. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll need to be able to shoot on the fly. &nbsp;And since the ball will drain if you hold up the flipper to get it to roll up the wire guide, cradling isn&rsquo;t as easy as on modern games. &nbsp;Dead bouncing is the best way to get to a cradle. You&rsquo;ll have plenty of opportunity to do dead bounces off shots to the drops but be careful: &nbsp;a too-fast dead bounce will also roll up and out the gap above the flippers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The suit lanes also light corresponding lanes at the bottom; more lights, more points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When the ball is headed out one of the side lanes, you can often still save it with a well-timed nudge as it gets to the post below the outer edge of the bottom of the lane. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t nudge too soon!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Jacks to Open [SS - Gottlieb, 1984]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: Shoot drop targets to finish poker hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The is a solid state remake of Jacks Open with a slightly different ruleset and score values ten times higher. &nbsp;The strategy is changed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As on Jacks Open, you start by going for two Jacks, then three Queens, then a Full House of three queens and two kings, then the royal flush of all five hearts. &nbsp;The order of the drop targets differs though: &nbsp;on Jacks Open, it&rsquo;s A-Q-K-J-Q-K-J-Q-10; here, it&rsquo;s A-K-K-Q-Q-Q-J-J-10. &nbsp;The five royal flush drop targets are in the same places, but the other four cards have moved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Here, the top lanes light matching-colored side lanes, return lanes and outlanes, rather than increasing the value of the drop targets. &nbsp;Drops targets are always worth 5K. &nbsp;The lit upper star bumper is worth 10K; the center and unlit star bumper 100 points unlit, 1K lit. &nbsp;The star bumpers are each lit by the outer top lane above them and stay lit for the rest of the game. &nbsp;The skill shot is therefore to get one of those two outer top lanes to light a star bumper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unlike Jacks Open, this game has end of ball bonus: &nbsp;10K per card earned. &nbsp;A royal flush earns double bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On Jacks Open, your strategy is to milk the target banks after you raise the target values rather than completing each &ldquo;hand&rdquo; as quickly as possible. &nbsp;Here on Jack TO Open, you want to finish hands in the minimum number of shots to get to Royal Flush a.s.a.p. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s still good to have as many upper lanes as you can to light the lower lanes, but now, putting the ball back up top to do so is no longer a priority.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Earned top lanes and cards are held from ball to ball.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">James Bond [SS - Gottlieb, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Hit the lower left standup five times;

the fifth one scores 50K, resets the multiplier to 1X and turns it on for 10 units. &nbsp;This target might not be active when your time count is below 30 units; check if you can. &nbsp;When lit, the center drop target on the left 5-bank adds 3 units, as does the standup target on the left below the wide lane down from the top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You cannot accumulate more than 50 units; that&rsquo;s a hard cap. &nbsp;When the clock is at zero, hitting the right bullseye target adds 15 units, assuming the game is set to award time rather than a free game (the light there says Special).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Now to look at bonus and other values. &nbsp;Drop target values are the lit value in the playfield circle from 100 to 800 times your current bonus multiplier. &nbsp;Each drop target hit advances the value around the circle; when you&rsquo;re at 800, the next target moves it back to 100 but increases your bonus multiplier. &nbsp;Drop targets and return lanes add bonus. The far upper left channel always gives 5K and a bonus advance, lit or not. &nbsp;Bonus goes up to 99K and is displayed on the backglass left of the timer. &nbsp;The recessed bullseye target at the lower right adds 15 bonus and 15K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Game strategy is to get your bonus multiplier up to 5X a.s.a.p. and in the process light that standup target to add 10 time units. &nbsp;If you get that far, just keep smacking drop targets and hit the standup or upper left channel to the top to add time when needed. &nbsp;The problem is, this game is a widebody and tends to play slow with all that empty space. &nbsp;It gets really annoying to watch the ball float around while precious seconds tick away. &nbsp;Combine that with the 50-unit cap, unlike the other time-based games where your can earn more than you start with, and you find your time often runs out before you can get enough done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Trivia note: &nbsp;the

controlled shot. &nbsp;The other way to score safely is to shoot the ball up the sides of the game, trying to get the ball to rattle around in the bumpers as long as possible. &nbsp;This sometimes produces an &ldquo;around the world&rdquo; shot which may hit more than one of the light bumpers and advance bonus standup targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are two ball saver posts on the game, a light-up center one and a smaller one in the right outlane. &nbsp;The center post is raised by hitting the standup target at the far left of the center saucer; the right outlane post is raised by a similar standup target on the right. &nbsp;Both posts are lowered when you hit either the down posts standup on the right or the down posts rollover button near the westgate on the left. &nbsp;When the center post is up, you can let the ball settle between it and either flipper to set up shots. &nbsp;The right outlane post, though, is not foolproof - - the ball can sneak around it and still drain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Assuming the bumpers are reasonably lively, I don&rsquo;t bother shooting for the center spin saucer, I just go up the sides of the game and try to get the ball to bounce off of the bumpers into the top saucer or roll down into the center saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Try to hit the left target to raise the center post a.s.a.p. &nbsp;That will make subsequent shots safer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Don&rsquo;t ever shoot at the standup targets on either side of the center saucer; you&rsquo;ll advance the bonus more safely with the upper targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is not awarded at the end of a ball, only by collecting it via a spin. &nbsp;One downside to this game is that the spin values are random, so luck can play a part in the game outcome, e.g. if you get 1,000 and your opponent gets double bonus for 20,000.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c17 c15

all day, Aces and Queens first. &nbsp;Hit the EB standup if enabled and lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Smack targets, then smack more targets. &nbsp;Aces all day is one option. &nbsp;But if you love drop targets, this is a game for you, since that&rsquo;s about all there is to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Getting 5X bonus on each ball is desired, done via one shot on ball 1 (hit the 10), by two or three shots on ball 2 (get the three queens; this assumes 3-ball game settings), and by however many shots it takes on ball 3 to get the five aces. &nbsp;You only get bonus for completed sets of cards, at 1X each base or at 5X if you finish the goal rank [10, Q&rsquo;s, A&rsquo;s] for that ball. &nbsp;You do get a base 1X bonus for the &ldquo;goal&rdquo; card rank. &nbsp;The 10 and pair of jacks are linked as far as targets resetting goes - - the Q, K and A banks each reset when completed, but the 10 and Jacks only reset when both are completed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The big points here, though, are hitting any targets _after_ you&rsquo;ve completed that set once during a ball. &nbsp;They score 5000 each at that point, which is where most of a top score will come from. &nbsp;For the Aces, get the two on the right by threading your shot between the Js and the Qs; get the second and third from the left with shots off the upper left wall. &nbsp;The target on the far left is hard to hit from the bottom; use the upper flipper or nudges off the left bumper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If extra balls are on, there are two ways to get one: &nbsp;finishing either the Aces or the A-B-C lanes will light the EB stand up target in the extreme upper right. &nbsp;Since you can get the B via either return lane at the bottom, you should plunge for the A or A lane whenever EBs are active. &nbsp;I prefer the A, if possible, since if you later get the B via a ball through a return lane, then you just need the C up top. &nbsp;If you manage to get the ball up there where you can nudge it into the C, you have an opportunity to immediately collect the EB when the ball falls through the top C lane onto the pop bumper if you can nudge so that the rebound off of the right bumper is into the EB target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Two drop targets are noticeably riskier for draining out the right side: &nbsp;the right hand Jack target and the bottom King target.</span></p><p class="c4"><span

since it has different scoring, it gets its own listing. &nbsp;Only about 8% of the 10,000 Joker Pokers made were EMs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s no 5X bonus in the EM version. &nbsp;Your bonus multiplier is just 2X if you complete the A-B-C lanes, either at the top or the return lanes and outlanes. &nbsp;Note you can drain to turn on double bonus when you have the B and either the A or the C and the ball drains out the one letter you&rsquo;re missing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You still want to complete sets of drop targets to enable base bonus: &nbsp;the 10 for 1K, the two jacks for 2K, the three queens for 3K, the four kings for 4K and the aces and joker for 5K. &nbsp;Having some targets in a rank set but not all of them does not get you any bonus. &nbsp;Maximum base bonus is thus 15K, maximum overall bonus 30K when doubled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unlike the Solid State version, the drops targets on the EM do NOT reset when you complete a bank. &nbsp;The targets aren&rsquo;t worth as much, either - - 500 for the 10, jacks and queens, 1000 for the aces and kings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If extra balls are on, there are two ways to get one: &nbsp;finishing either the Aces or the A-B-C lanes will light the EB stand up target in the extreme upper right. &nbsp;Since you can get the B via

draining out the right side: &nbsp;the right hand Jack target and the bottom King target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The strategy on the game is UTAD until you&rsquo;ve got A-B-C and the aces, then try to finish the lower drop targets. &nbsp;Once the targets are all down, about all you can do to score is resume UTAD to get some 1000 point bumper hits. &nbsp;This is probably why the scoring was changed when Gottlieb came out with the SS version.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Joust [EM - Bally, 1969]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD along the left wall into the top mushroom bumper from the right flipper, and through the gate at the top right from the left flipper. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Joust is an odd-ball game with layout and rules different from most others of its era. &nbsp;It has no drop targets, no spinner, no end-of-ball bonus and a two-stage outlane with no return lane on the left. &nbsp;The primary scoring is via a set of nine white rollover disks in a chamber at the upper right of the playfield. &nbsp;Completing specific sets of numbers earns you points: &nbsp;1 through 6 for 3000, 7-8-9 for 5000 and all nine for 10000. &nbsp;The ball enters the chamber from the upper left, shootable from either flipper. &nbsp;Once in the chamber, it deflects off pins, the rollovers and dividers, scoring three of the numbers on the way down. &nbsp;Obviously, you want to nudge the game so the ball goes over number you haven&rsquo;t got yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Five of the numbers can be earned outside the chamber, as marked on the playfield. &nbsp;Get the 1 from the center mushroom bumper, which also scores 1000. &nbsp;Get the 2 and the 6 from the side mushroom bumpers, which also open the flippers if closed. &nbsp;The top left mushroom bumper gives you the 4, closes the bumpers and scores 1000, making it a good thing to shoot for if you can&rsquo;t backhand the chamber from the right flipper. &nbsp;The top saucer gets you the 5, which is naturally your desired Skill Shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Any shot into the chamber opens the flippers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s a ball save gate on the right outlane of the machine. &nbsp;You open it by hitting the white rollover disk above and to the right of the right flipper. &nbsp;If you can nudge a ball exiting the chamber to go over it, definitely do so. &nbsp;You can shoot at it with the left flipper [late flip, somewhat dangerous - - a miss-hit may just drain out that same right outlane], or hit it from the right flipper with a n early backhand shot when the flippers are zipped and the ball cradled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The game overall is pretty much UTAD. &nbsp;The exceptions I&rsquo;d make are if you just need the 1, 2 or 6 digit to reach to one of the &ldquo;lighting&rdquo; scores, go ahead and hit the mushroom bumper to get it, just try to graze the it on the inner side so that the ball continues up the playfield after the shot.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Jubilee [EM - Williams, 1973]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD via the side slingshots, ideally by going over either of the small rollover buttons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Jubilee is very similar to SkyLab / Spacelab, with the same central captive ball horseshoe and side slingshot design. &nbsp;Where it differs is in having no return lanes, instead having scoop kickers behind the flipper elbows as on Space Mission. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What to do? &nbsp;Build your bonus, keep the ball alive; the points in the game other than bonus are trivial. &nbsp;Yawn. &nbsp;Bonus is earned by the top lanes (two when lit), by looping a captive ball to the opposite side, by the two small rollover buttons next to the bottom of the captive ball enclosure and by the outlanes. &nbsp;Bonus goes up to 20K. &nbsp;Bonus is doubled on last ball; double bonus cannot be earned on other balls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Because the game is so unbalanced towards bonus, you rarely see it in competition; a player with a big lead is all but impossible to catch.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Juke Box [EM &ndash; Chicago Coin, 1976]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: Hit the C-D-E-F standup targets, then UTAD until your bonus is at maximum. &nbsp;After that, hit the spin standups all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This game has two shots that are both important and difficult. &nbsp;The right orbit is narrower than most, so the ball often hits the left edge of the gap next to the special button and fails to go through. &nbsp;The other is the top saucer, which you have no direct shot for; UTAD plus nudging is your only hope.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The letter standup targets increase values: &nbsp;get C &amp; D, the middle ones opposite the center triangle, to light the spinner; the lower pair, E &amp; F, to light the hole for Double Bonus; and the upper left two, A &amp; B light the extra ball lane, if enabled. &nbsp;Get C-D-E-F and ignore A-B unless extra balls are on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus goes up to 19K, advanced by the return lanes, top lanes and three rollover buttons but not by the standup targets. &nbsp;The double bonus hole can&rsquo;t be shot directly; just get your C-D, go UTAD and hope-and-nudge. &nbsp;Bonus here is slow to build, so focus first on lighting the spinner before going after double bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The spinner is not the usual ball-goes-through kind, it&rsquo;s two standup targets than make a pinwheel below the playfield spin. &nbsp;The rebounds from the spin standups are chancy, but it&rsquo;s good value when lit for 1K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The top two lanes alternate which is lit on hits to the three small white rollover buttons. &nbsp;The lit lane is worth 3K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The preferred strategy is to hit the C, D, E and F targets to light the double bonus hole and the spinner. &nbsp;After that, shoot the right orbit up top to get advances until your bonus is at 19K and hopefully have the ball drop into the double bonus saucer on one of those trips. &nbsp;Once your bonus is filled up, shoot the spin standups from then on. &nbsp;If you have the ball on the right flipper and can&rsquo;t transfer it easily to the left, shoot C or E if you need either, otherwise shoot the spin standups.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you find the right orbit shot is too narrow for you, your best alternative is to shoot towards the A target from the right flipper and hope that bumper action kicks the ball up into the double bonus saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;rebounds from the spin standups and from missed right orbit shots.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Jumping Jack [EM &ndash; Gottlieb, 1973]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;drop targets all day, but if you have the ball cradled on a flipper and the opposite-side upper center saucer is lit, go for the saucer instead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;shoot the lit saucer. &nbsp;Important: &nbsp;you usually do this by having the ball drop through the lane opposite from the lit saucer, not on the same side! &nbsp;Most of the time, the ball will hit the metal rail above the saucer and bounce over the top post to the other side. &nbsp;The lit saucer scores 3000 and lights the drops for 1000 each in bonus. &nbsp;Those are way more important than going through the lit lane at the top for 500 vs. 50. &nbsp;The center lane, worth 500, is too great a risk of not going into the lit saucer and not worth the risk. &nbsp;In any case, if your ball is about to go somewhere other than into the opposing top lane, try to nudge it to not cross over [if same side] or roll to the lit side [center lane]. &nbsp;But don&rsquo;t tilt!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy: &nbsp;when the ball is on the flipper on the side opposite the lit saucer, shoot the top arc for the saucer. &nbsp;When the ball is on the same side, shoot for the drop targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The upper flippers are good for shooting drop targets, and you can sometimes do a back-and-forth shot or two where the rebound off the target goes to the opposite upper flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Whenever possible, hold up the upper flippers to cradle the ball and try to get it to roll up the lanes above those flippers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing the drop targets twice scores the accumulated bonus [either 10x100 or 10x1000] and pops the targets back up. &nbsp;Completing them twice scores an extra ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Balls in the bumpers will come back into play more often than not (unless that particular machine is run down). &nbsp;When you see the ball heading for the top of a bumper, though, try to nudge so that it bounces up where one of the upper flippers can hit it. &nbsp;If your game has really lively bumpers, you may want to hold up the flipper on the side where the ball is rattling around the bumper - - if it comes out to the center quickly, the bumper can smack it down the middle before you can react. &nbsp;A raised flipper is a bit of a drain shield in this case.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Jungle [EM - Gottlieb, 1973]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD via the side rollovers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span

after the ball goes through either return lane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">While there are both upper and lower playfields on Jungle Lord, your best bet for both points and ball safety is to stay up top. &nbsp;The top drop target 5-bank is progressive: &nbsp;knock down one, then two, etc. until you need to get all five. &nbsp;It then shifts to &ldquo;double trouble&rdquo; mode with random timed targets and progressively doubling scoring: 10K, 20K, etc. up to 160K if you finish them in time. &nbsp;Partial progress is held from ball to ball.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Jungle Lord was the first machine to use double scoring without requiring multiball. &nbsp;Get the numbers 1-5, the first three via standups [#1 is above the upper left flipper, #2 and #3 tucked next to the ramps], the last two via the return lanes. &nbsp;Double scoring is good for the rest of the ball.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Multiball, sadly, requires some luck and is also time-limited. &nbsp;You need to get all four chutes in the upper left mini-playfield, but shots to it go into lanes by luck, so you could get 10 hits to it and not get all four letters. &nbsp;A ball is kicked into it for shooting the eject holes or completing the timed drop targets. &nbsp;If you do get all four letters, shoot either saucer to start a 35-second multiball. &nbsp;It is possible to extend the time by getting the far top right mini-ball kick saucer.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Bonus can be good on this game. &nbsp;The base goes up to 39K (?), and the multiplier up to 10X; raising the multiplier requires a shot through the horseshoe between the center and left ramps after the ball rolls through either return lane. &nbsp;The shot is on a timer; you have more time at first, for 2X, and the time the shot stays lit gets shorter for each level; levels are 2X, 3X, 5X, 10X. &nbsp;Making the shot after a return lane one more time, with 10X already lit, lights an outlane ball save.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">The magna-saves on this game are on timers, too, with seconds of &ldquo;grab&rdquo; earned by hitting the side drop targets. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t forget to use that extra set of buttons to possibly avoid a side drain.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Jungle

flippers with a bounce-back area underneath. &nbsp;Balls going into either outlane behind the upper flippers can hit the rubbered posts below and bounce back up onto the ledges next to the lower flippers. &nbsp;This works best if you hold the upper flippers up. &nbsp;The configuration also means you have attempted-cradle drain risk: &nbsp;if you hold the lower flipper up as the ball approaches and it hits the upper part of the flipper and rolls upward, the ball can go up that ledge and into the outlane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The flipper setup tends to make this a &ldquo;flow&rdquo; game since it can be difficult to get the ball cradled on either an upper or lower flipper. &nbsp;Since few of your shots will be precise controlled ones from a cradle, you&rsquo;ll need to learn to aim on the fly.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">King Kool [EM - Gottlieb, 1972]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;get the K-I-N-G

targets. &nbsp;Shoot the center rotating disk when it displays a number you lack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;get a lit lane for 50 points. &nbsp;I prefer the 9 and 6 lanes since after rolling through these, the ball is likely to hit a bumper and score the K or Q target, possibly bouncing back and forth to do so more than once. &nbsp;Balls missing the lanes completely and coming through on either side of the center bumper are the worst.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Your end of ball bonus is 10 points per card scored, but the game keeps track if you have finished all of them and will give you a second &ldquo;hand&rdquo; of bonuses for another set of cards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center cylinder has various cards on it, but only the three facing you can readily be hit at any given moment. &nbsp;All ten lanes on the game spin the cylinder to reveal other cards. &nbsp;Shoot it to collect any cards you lack; if the three cards you can hit are ones you already have, go up top. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t bother shooting the Jack or 10 targets above the return lanes, those shots are risky if made, riskier if missed. &nbsp;Try to pick them up off the cylinder instead. &nbsp;You might also get them by accident with a shot that&rsquo;s too weak to go up top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you&rsquo;re close to finishing all 13 cards, make your priority doing so; once complete, all 13 cards become available again for another set of end-of-ball bonus. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a lot easier to get a bunch more quickly when all 13 are &ldquo;new&rdquo; than when you&rsquo;ve already got most of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you see the ball nearing one of the side &ldquo;spin roto&rdquo; lanes, try to get it to go through there rather than roll off the other side of those triangles towards the center. &nbsp;Key feeds are how the ball comes out of these #4 and #5 side lanes, and off the triangular wedges next to them.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">King Pin [EM - Gottlieb, 1973]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Shoot lit drop targets all day. &nbsp;If you have a ball cradled and no lit drop targets in the line of fire, go up top [in front of the face of the upper slingshots].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">How about a straight row of 10 drop targets? &nbsp;Ten bowling pins, ten drops. &nbsp;How About a game where making bank shots is important? &nbsp;Here, it&rsquo;s all about hitting the lit pin, worth 5000 instead of the base 500 points. &nbsp;The star rollover in the center of the game moves the lit pin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Skill Shot is to drop the ball into the lit saucer at the top for 5000; that&rsquo;s big points on this machine. &nbsp;The unlit one is worth just 500 and missing both is common if you&rsquo;re careless. &nbsp;Line up your Skill Shot mark and prepare to nudge a bit to make sure you get it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once the ball falls down to the top of the playfield, try to hit the lit pin for 5000. &nbsp;Hitting unlit ones is okay, too, since completing them will score 5000 and reset them, guaranteeing some points and that one Is again lit. &nbsp;When the ball exits the top, it usually rolls smoothly down the face of one of the top slingshots without triggering it. &nbsp;Timing your shots when the ball gets to the flippers is critical on this game. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll be banking your shots off of the opposite slingshot, so think about the angles when you shoot. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll find that shots to the drop targets often rebound towards the other flipper due to the angle you&rsquo;re shooting from, allowing you to do some back-and-forth target shooting. &nbsp;Some hits will rebound more down the center, where you can try to catch them on the lower flippers and take straight-up shots from there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you have the ball cradled on a lower flipper when there is no lit pin on the opposite side of the playfield up top to shoot at, try shooting the ball just in front of the upper slingshot all the way to the top of the game to score a 5000 saucer there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The side outlane angles here are a bit different from other machines; balls going in fast that don&rsquo;t touch the top curve have a decent chance to bounce off the side wall into the return lanes. &nbsp;When the ball goes in slowly or hits that curve, you&rsquo;re likely toast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds - - balls through the top side lanes; ideally, you want the ball to come to the opposite flipper and get to a cradle.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Kings of Steel [SS &ndash; Bally, 1984]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;Right side standup target all day if unmodified. &nbsp;If modified, same target from the left flipper, UTAD from the right flipper and hit the 3-target bank with the upper mini-flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to flipper: &nbsp;Left unmodified, bias right modified.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If the machine is set up factory, right target all day dominates all other strategies. &nbsp;Who wins is whomever survives the target rebounds best and can consistently transfer the ball from the right flipper to the left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Because this strategy is both well known and not that hard to execute, Kings of Steel may be modified when used in a tournament. &nbsp;One such mod is to create a gate below the standup so that shots to it exit into the plunger lane, and to also remove the gate behind the left flipper to make it harder to get control of the ball on that flipper to make the target shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For this latter scenario, used at INDISC 2019, there&rsquo;s now a dual strategy: &nbsp;you should still shoot the right target if you have the ball cradled on the left flipper, but now the safer route is to get the ball to the right flipper and go up top all day. &nbsp;Your goal is now to hit as many of the white card rollover buttons as possible before having the ball drop into the top saucer. &nbsp;You get 10K per lit card; completing them lights the 40K extra light, two sets of cards lights the 80K extra light, so you can get up to 110K per saucer shot with two sets plus three cards. &nbsp;Finishing the third set scores a special rather than points and resets the extra value to 40K, where it remains for the rest of the ball, making a maximal shot then 70K. &nbsp;Still, at 40K-70K per shot, it&rsquo;s a reliable source of points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is also important when not in the target default situation. &nbsp;Base bonus is 5K per card earned on the left side targets. &nbsp;The 10, Jacks and Queens are scored by hitting the drop targets. &nbsp;Kings and the Ace are scored by hitting the stand-up targets behind the drops. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a bit tricky to tell how much bonus you have; unlike most games, Kings of Steel only displays the &ldquo;active&rdquo; row of lights for bonus, rather than all items that have been collected that add to bonus. &nbsp;You must collect cards in poker order: &nbsp;the 10, then 2 Jacks, then 3 Queens, then a full house of 3 Queens and 2 Jacks. &nbsp;Once you have your full house, the drop targets stay down and you work on your 4 Kings plus the Ace with the standup targets. &nbsp;Partial card sets award bonus for your degree of progress: &nbsp;if you&rsquo;re working on the full house, you have 6 bonus cards banked (1:10+2:J+3:Q) plus your progress towards full house, so if you have two Queens and a Jack in the full house row, you&rsquo;ve got 9 cards total for 45K base bonus. &nbsp;Finishing the 4 Kings and Ace to complete the set of 16 cards raises your banked super bonus by 80K and starts another set. &nbsp;Super Bonus goes up to four sets of cards for 320K base, so with 4 sets plus 15 of 16 cards, your maximum base bonus is 395K. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing the three Deuce targets at the upper left near the mini-flipper advances your bonus multiplier in steps up to 5X. &nbsp;With a 5X bonus multiplier, that&rsquo;s 1.975 million maximum bonus. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Cards are also spotted for getting the top saucer, either return lane, and one of the six possible center target values.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The ball save gate on the right is opened by hitting the center red standup target when the light below it says &ldquo;open gate,&rdquo; one of 6 possible values for the target. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s best to ignore that center target, though, it&rsquo;s drainy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the Indisc setup, best strategy is up top (above the upper flipper) from the right flipper and right standup target from the left flipper.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Kiss [SS - Bally, 1979]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Up Top until your bonus is at least 44,000, i.e. you&rsquo;ve finished one full set of four &ldquo;K-I-S-S&rdquo; letters and lit the 44K insert. &nbsp;At that point, if you haven&rsquo;t already collected the A-B-C-D targets for double bonus, go ahead and do so. &nbsp;Then UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced, except Left to get Double Bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Skill Shot is a Big Deal, since the center lane, when the Yellow light is lit, opens the right-hand gate, and when the White light is lit, it spots you a full set of Kiss letters. &nbsp;If you get it with both lit, great! &nbsp;This is another reason for going UTAD, to get the ball up top for a chance to open the gate when you don&rsquo;t already have it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s a drop target bank on the left that scores Kiss when completed, plus four individual Kiss letter standup targets spread around the playfield. &nbsp;Ignore both of these completely. &nbsp;Doing anything other than shooting the ball up top through either spinner risks hitting the underside of a bumper, either directly or on a rebound, and getting drained. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re better off getting the letters from the top five lanes, and of course ideally that center one when lit. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll undoubtably get some Kiss letters from these targets anyway, just don&rsquo;t bother trying to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The only time to not go for the spinner is once your bonus is high enough, e.g. you have at least finished the letters four times to light the 40K super bonus, then you can go for the A-B-C-D standup bank on the right to get your double bonus. &nbsp;If Extra Balls are on, you can go for this bank a second time, which will earn you the EB. &nbsp;If EBs are off, ignore this bank, too, once you have your double bonus.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Klondike [EM &ndash; Williams, 1971]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Line up matching symbols on the reels, then shoot the center collect saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This game and it&rsquo;s sibling, the 4-player Gold Rush, are very similar to Yukon. &nbsp;The difference is that these have a center saucer, a bumper blocking easy access to the top reels from the flippers, no return lanes, and a center post. &nbsp;Yukon has return lanes, no center saucer, no center bumper and no center post. &nbsp;Klondike has posts behind the flippers that prevent the ball from draining between the flippers and the slingshots as can happen on Doodle Bug. &nbsp;Gold Rush lacks those posts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The scoring is somewhat obscure since it&rsquo;s based on how well your slot machine reels at the top match up. &nbsp;With mixed reel symbols, e.g. three different or two of one and one of another, collecting the reel value scores 500. &nbsp;When there are three of the same symbol showing, the reel value goes up. &nbsp;A &ldquo;wagon&rdquo; serves as a wild card. &nbsp;Three hats or two hat plus a wagon is worth 3000. &nbsp;Three pans or two pans plus a wagon is worth 4000. &nbsp;Three lanterns or two lanterns plus a wagon is worth 5000 plus an extra ball if enabled. &nbsp;Three wagons is worth 5000 (and a special).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are seven places to score the reel value: &nbsp;both top lanes, both top saucers, both outlanes and the center saucer. &nbsp;The top two saucers also each light a pair of bumpers when collected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hitting any reel advances it, with the reel moving top-forwards towards the player. &nbsp;Reels are also advanced by the top rollover buttons and mid-playfield standup targets (left and right) and by the two side lanes (center reel). &nbsp;The side lanes also raise your center post; a rollover button at the bottom lowers the post.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The current reel value is preserved when a new game is started. &nbsp;If you begin a game with it lit for more than 500 points, try to soft plunge for the score reel lane at the top right without hitting the advance reel rollover above it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center post is raised by going through either of the two side lanes that advance the center reel. &nbsp;A small rollover button a few inches above the post lowers it. &nbsp;As with any center post, if it&rsquo;s up, don&rsquo;t flip; use it to get control of the ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy is somewhat UTAD unless the reels are lined up for increased value. &nbsp;If they&rsquo;re at high value, try to keep collecting the reel value at the center saucer without changing them. &nbsp;If you see a good lineup available if you change a reel, try to advance the appropriate reel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Both Gold Rush and Klondike suffer from &ldquo;block-itis&rdquo; by which I mean many of the things you might want to hit cannot be shot directly from the flippers. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t hit either upper saucer to light the bumpers other than through a bank shot or help from the bumpers. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t hit the advance reel targets at the top without bumper help even though these are safer than hitting the targets lower down. &nbsp;And one last indignity, that collect reel value saucer in the center, the only one you can shoot directly? &nbsp;The saucer is shallow enough that shots at it often skip right through it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Knockout [EM - Bally, 1975]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD, through either spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot is the center wiggly lane leading to the saucer. &nbsp;When the ball is up top, if you can&rsquo;t nudge it into the wiggly knockout lane, the two outside lanes over the bumpers with the white lights are better than the two inner lanes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One of the center wiggly awards is double bonus, but it&rsquo;s on a switch hit cycle, you can&rsquo;t change it on your own. &nbsp;If it&rsquo;s not lit, just go up top again, eventually it will be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ignore the two bottom standup targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for the center saucer, it scores 30 the first time shot, 300 the next time, and 3000 per shot thereafter for the rest of that ball. &nbsp; But it&rsquo;s a risky shot due to the posts on either side, so I usually don&rsquo;t bother shooting directly at the saucer either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;when the ball comes down through either spinner, does it trigger the slingshot or roll down to a flipper? &nbsp;And how&rsquo;s the kickout from the center saucer? &nbsp;The saucer kickout should hit the left flipper, but you need to determine if you should dead bounce, live catch, hold up the flipper, or maybe need to nudge, too, if it tends to come out too close to the slingshot or flipper pivot. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s possible for the ball to lip out of that saucer as well, which can lead to an instant drain. &nbsp;If lip-outs happen too often, try to nudge just before the ball gets to the saucer to ensure that it goes in.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Lancers [EM - Gottlieb, 1961]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version and total version: &nbsp;plunge for a different lane, other than the center one, each ball, ideally starting with the &ldquo;light A&rdquo; and &ldquo;light B&rdquo; 30-point lanes. &nbsp;Shoot the A and B side lanes when lit; otherwise, UTAD via the gap between the outer saucers and the A and B lanes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Laser Ball [SS &ndash; Williams, 1979]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill shot: &nbsp;any needed number lane; don&rsquo;t let the ball roll down the right orbit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The game revolves around the 10 numbered lanes and rollovers. &nbsp;The top lanes score one or two numbers &ndash; two if you need both of them, as on your first plunge. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s no lane change, so after that, you need to nudge towards numbers you lack. &nbsp;The other way to get numbers is individually by hitting the 10 bowling-pin-pattern star rollovers in the middle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Each time you complete all 10 numbers, your &ldquo;AE&rdquo; value, which starts at 10K, goes up by 10K to a possible 60K. &nbsp;AE value is scored by completing the B-A-L-L drop targets in the upper right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The game has the usual 29K base bonus and 2X-3X-5X multipliers. &nbsp;Base bonus comes from top return and outlanes, the standup target on the left and the BALL targets. &nbsp;Bonus X is advanced by either the bullseye target or the saucer, these each just outside and below the top 1-10 lanes. &nbsp;The left bullseye is the harder shot, up a somewhat narrow chute. &nbsp;Once the bonus multiplier is at 5X, one more hit lights the spinners for 1000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The L-A-S-E-R drop targets are here mainly to produce extra balls and specials. &nbsp;Completing Laser scores 5K the first time and goes up 5K per set until it reaches 20K. &nbsp;The outside bottom kickback &ldquo;collect&rdquo; arcs score 1000 for each star lit up to 10. &nbsp;Best to ignore them, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sadly, even though this is a wide body game with room for lots of features, it&rsquo;s not worth doing anything but shooting the two orbits to the top. &nbsp;You can get all your bonus and all your AE advances up there, and balls falling through the top lanes into the bumpers will randomly rack up the BALL target sets and the right advance bonus X saucer eventually. &nbsp;The Laser targets and center star rollovers aren&rsquo;t worth risking shots at due to center and right rebound drain risk. &nbsp;Avoid using the upper right flipper if possible; if you can hold it up so that the ball deflects off it safely, do that rather than flip.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Laser Cue [SS - Williams, 1984]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Shoot the center drop targets in order from right to left, then go Up Top until your multiplier is at 5X or better. &nbsp;Now shoot the recessed 6-ball and 7-ball targets, then the

targets hit out of order reset; on Laser Cue, though, your value is not reduced when you miss. &nbsp;Next, go up top to get sets of P-O-O-L letters [like the kings on Alien Poker] to advance your multiplier. &nbsp;In this case, this is advancing your end-of-ball bonus. &nbsp;Bonus multiplier goes up to 20X, but not one step at a time; it goes 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20. &nbsp;Bonus X of 10 or higher will reset at the end of the ball back down to 5X.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As with Alien Poker and Paragon, the right flipper is a double, and you must be careful to not lose the ball by scissoring it between them (especially not on camera!). &nbsp;You can cradle on the upper flipper and then release the button to shoot with either one; the upper one is best for shots at the drop targets or to the left spinner, the lower one for shots at the #6/#14 target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unlike Alien Poker, you&rsquo;re not done when you&rsquo;ve completed the drops; you still need the 6, 7 and 8-balls. &nbsp;#6 is a recessed standup target at the lower left; #7 a recessed target at the lower right; #8 is at the very top left, made via a strong right orbit shot. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll find that you can complete these in a 3-shot combo if your timing is good. &nbsp;With the ball on the right flipper, shoot the #6/#14 target; the rebound should come out to where you can one-time a shot from the left into the #7/#15; the rebound from that you should be able to let dead bounce off of the right flippers over to the left, where you can then shoot the 8-ball up top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For the first rack, the game spots you both balls shown for each of the drop targets, e.g. both the 1 and 9 when you hit the 1. &nbsp;After the first rack, you only get one ball at a time, so after you get the 8, &nbsp;you then go back to work on balls 9-13 via the drops, then 14 and 15 [recessed standups], which then light the top 8 saucer for extra ball, if on, and advances you to the next rack of 15 balls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Your bonus potential on this game: &nbsp;three full racks of 15 balls at 1000 each for 45K, plus a partial rack at the end, times a multiplier of up to 20X for a possible 900K+ in bonus! &nbsp;Yes, you want big bonus here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The B-A-L-L standup targets serve to advance you one ball when completed, an alternative to hitting a target. &nbsp;&ldquo;Pool&rdquo; does a tiny bit, too, since each time you complete it, you get both bonus multiplier advance and a letter in Ball, i.e. 1/16 of a numbered ball for each letter in Pool. &nbsp;Ball itself has another use: &nbsp;completing it lights the spinner on the left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The C-U-E targets are mostly about points, 10K, 20K, 30K then 50K per set; at 50K, each set also advances you one ball in the rack. &nbsp;The only way to get CUE is with the upper mini-flipper, which is right of center on the playfield but is still a &ldquo;left&rdquo; flipper by angle and controlled by the left button. &nbsp;I prefer to use the upper flipper to shoot the ball around to the right of the Cue bank up top to advance Pool. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll get some CUEs anyway from mini-flipper shots that are unable to go up top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">An interesting feature of the 6 and 7 targets is the increased value you get for hitting them when lit if you hit those targets a few times before they&rsquo;re lit. &nbsp;The shot value rises as shown by the orange lights leading out of the recesses &ndash; 10K, 20K, 30K then maxes at 50K.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Lawman [EM - Gottlieb, 1971]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;Shoot the standup target on the right side but outside the plinko lanes to open the gate, then shoot the ball to the top right and into the plinko lanes. &nbsp;If the gate is still open when the ball exits the plinkos, repeat; if not, reopen the gate. &nbsp;Shoot drop targets when the ball is on the right flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is a 2-player version of Sheriff; it shares the playfield layout with Atlantis as well, but the rules for Atlantis differ from Lawman and Sheriff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s a ball save gate on the right, but not all the way down at outlane level, it&rsquo;s one waterfall channel tier above that. &nbsp;The standup targets that are sequence advance on Atlantis are open and close gate targets here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unlike Atlantis, there&rsquo;s no extra value in knocking down a pair of left side drop targets with a single shot. &nbsp;But since it&rsquo;s still worth an extra 5000 when you finish the bank, they&rsquo;re still a primary goal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">The plinko lanes are more important than on Atlantis, since a lit lane here is now the most valuable shot on the game, but you still need to be cautious when shooting for them due to drain risk out the bottom right if your gate isn&rsquo;t open. &nbsp;If the gate </span><span class="c17 c5 c9">is</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;open, definitely shoot to the top right to enter the plinko lanes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">The advance bonus lanes at the top and in the waterfall are synchronized. &nbsp;One set is top left and right lanes plus R-L-R-L as you go down the waterfall and R on the lower left outlanes. &nbsp;Change the 1000</span><span class="c5 c23">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">reel and they all flip to the others.</span></p><p

1978]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c9">Quickie version: &nbsp;Shoot the left side standup target just once to lite the top saucer and side lane above the score bonus chute. &nbsp;Shoot the drop target 3-bank on the</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c9">right to get to 5X bonus. &nbsp;Then UTAD via the right spinner and left drop target</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">bank. &nbsp;Shoot left side Score Lit Bonus chute when value is 7K or higher and bonus multiplier is 3X or higher.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to Flipper: &nbsp;Left at first, Right once bonus X raised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill shot: &nbsp;the top saucer; will likely require some nudging to fine-tune the bounces off the top side rubbers so the ball lands in it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A fun game, though it can be frustratingly drainy at times. &nbsp;This one&rsquo;s all about building bonus, collecting it during the ball, and rebuilding it as many times as you can. &nbsp;Base bonus is built up via the top saucer, the spinner (every four spins), the left chute and the mid-game slingshots; value goes up to 19K. &nbsp;The most important thing to do to build base bonus is hit that left standup target right away. &nbsp;This increases how many bonus advances the top saucer and upper left rollover (above the collect bonus chute) score from 1 to 3, plus raising the value of each to 5000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Getting base bonus to 10K lights the spinner for 1K per spin as well. &nbsp;This stays on for the rest of the ball even after you collect bonus in the chute.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Complete the right drop target 3-bank to raise your bonus multiplier. &nbsp;You can often get two targets in one shot since the ball is coming at them at a sharp angle, so it&rsquo;s frequently just two well-aimed shots to finish the bank, or six shots total to get to 5X. &nbsp;Random bounces, including off the lower two bumpers, can get you a target, too. &nbsp; Completing the drop target banks also gives decent value &ndash; 6K for the 3-bank, 10K for the 5-bank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The left return lane will light for 9000 when you hit the rollover button in the horseshoe behind the spinner. &nbsp;Not all horseshoe shots will roll over the button; the ball can bank off the walls of the curve. &nbsp;Only smooth shots along the arc will score the button. &nbsp;The return lane value resets once collected and must be relit with another button shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The return lanes are quite shatzable, and this is a good machine for learning and using the technique. &nbsp;The space above the flipper elbows is wider than on most games, making the shots easier and less risky; you can miss a perfect shot and still succeed with a good-enough shot. &nbsp;The situation where it&rsquo;s most beneficial to shatz is with the ball cradled on the right flipper when you need to hit the drop target three-bank on the right to advance your bonus multiplier: &nbsp;shatz from right to left to transfer the ball. &nbsp;Done right, you&rsquo;ll both transfer to set up the shot and score a return lane. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy on bonus collection: &nbsp;since the base bonus resets when collected but the multiplier does not, you want to wait until you have at least 3X to collect bonus. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;ll collect it before then due to random ball bounces, but don&rsquo;t actively shoot for it sooner than that. &nbsp;If you have 5X bonus lit and the top saucer and lane lit for 5K each, go for that chute all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unlike many solid state games, I&rsquo;ve never seen nor heard of Lectronomo being rolled in a tournament. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve come close (961K), but that&rsquo;s the best I know of. &nbsp;If you score 500K on it, you&rsquo;re all but certain to win your game. &nbsp;300K will win most of the time; an &ldquo;average&rdquo; score is in the low to mid 100&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Look to see if the side posts above the outlanes have been moved upward from their original positions. &nbsp;If so, the game will play tougher and the scores may be lower.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Liberty Bell [EM - Williams, 1977]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD via the spinners; shoot double bonus saucer if lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Also known as &ldquo;Grand Prix with no return lanes,&rdquo; like that game, this is a UTAD through the spinners, other than shooting for one of the double bonus saucers when you light it. &nbsp;Completing B+E or L+L lights the side saucers for double bonus; you need to get the saucer to activate the doubling. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s worth shooting at when your bonus is high, since bonus maxes out at a base of 100K, so a shot to double that is way more valuable than a spinner shot even with the top saucer at 30K [see below].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing B+E or L+L also advances the top saucer value from 500 to 5000, 10K, 20K and then 30K. &nbsp;This makes UTAD all the more valuable as your letter completions go up, since you not only get spinner points but a good chance at higher saucer points. &nbsp;The saucer kickout goes to the right bumper and will often then rebound into the E target for you, meaning you just need to nudge and or go back up top to try again to get the B target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Caution: &nbsp;when the ball hits the B or E targets, if it falls straight down, it&rsquo;s at high risk of a center drain. &nbsp;You want it to graze something as it exits the top playfield area so that it comes out at an angle.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Liberty Belle [EM - Gottlieb, 1962]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Hit the center standup target to light the bumpers, then UTAD. &nbsp;If you get a clean shot at a roto target lit for 10x, take it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">**Exactly** one of the roto targets is always lit; it cycles on switches. &nbsp;AFAIK, one bumper is always lit, too [also cycles], until you hit that center target, then all 3 are lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A few things regarding the roto targets:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">1. &nbsp;Your best chance at hitting the roto targets for score is &quot;bumper love,&quot; so get the ball rattling around the top as often and as rapidly as you can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">2. &nbsp;The inner roto targets, i.e. the two next to the top rollover entry lanes, can only be shot directly from the opposite side upper flipper, through a gap in the upper bumpers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">3. &nbsp;A good way to try to deliberately score one of the outer two roto targets when lit is a flying backhand, i.e. when the ball is coming out of the top bumpers towards an upper flipper, flip early and try to deflect the ball up into the target above the flipper. &nbsp;You actually have two or three chances to hit it that way - - one directly, one via a bank shot off the outer edge of the top bumper, and a slim one if the ball skims off the upper slingshot above it into the target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">4. &nbsp;It may be possible to score the outer rotos with shots from the lower flippers, but on some of these games, the flippers aren&#39;t strong enough to do so consistently. &nbsp;If that&#39;s the case, use the lower flippers to feed the upper ones and treat it like a two-stage rocket.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Little Chief [EM - Williams, 1975]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD, except shoot the right gate to collect bonus when it&rsquo;s doubled and at least 7,000 base.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right, except for shooting the collect bonus gate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Generally UTAD, but with a few specifics.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;the A lane at the top. &nbsp;B is okay, A is better. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;A lights the upper right advance bonus slingshot, while B lights the lower left advance bonus standup target. &nbsp;The upper right sling is by far the safer of the two to shoot at, and the more likely to be hit accidentally as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Keys here are building up bonus, doubling it, collecting it, repeating.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lots of stuff advances bonus - - top lanes, left center rollover button, standup targets. &nbsp;Double bonus is earned one of two ways: &nbsp;shooting the center saucer [or having the ball drop into it from above]; or collecting the top center lane when lit. &nbsp;That lane is lit by collecting both the A and B lanes next to it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Three saucer shots, or three lit center lanes, advances the saucer to level 3, where a drain out the lit side scores an extra ball [if enabled].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy: &nbsp;shoot up top until you get both A and B to light the bottom gate and the top center lane. &nbsp;Shoot top again to get the center lane for double bonus. &nbsp;Then shoot the open gate to collect bonus. &nbsp;Repeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Basically, every shot with the right flipper should be up top. &nbsp;From the left flipper, there are 4 choices, depending on where your bonus stands. &nbsp;If the base bonus is not maxed out, you can either transfer [may be risky] or shoot at the upper right &ldquo;advance bonus when lit&rdquo; mini-sling. &nbsp;If the bonus is maxed, or close, but not doubled and &ldquo;light double bonus&rdquo; is on, you can shoot the center saucer, but this is also risky since misses can drain. &nbsp;And if the bonus is doubled and at or close to maximum, your top priority is to shoot the collect bonus gate at the middle right of the machine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you&rsquo;re still building up bonus, try to get the ball to the right flipper; if your bonus is built up, try to get it to the left. &nbsp;Learning the feeds and using dead bounces and return lane transfers are the easiest ways to do so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;balls rolling down the left side over the 3 discs; balls through the upper right advance bonus lane; the kickout from the center saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key Feed Caution Zone: &nbsp;when the ball is approaching the center saucer from above, it may encounter the post directly above the saucer. &nbsp;It may or may not also hit one of the two posts below the sides of the saucer. &nbsp;In either case, if the ball falls to the outside of the side posts, you risk a drain out that side of the machine, either directly or off the top of one of the slingshots. &nbsp;Nudge to avoid the ball rolling outside; if you can&rsquo;t prevent that, be ready to try a nudge lower down to avoid side draining. &nbsp;You want the ball to go to the inside of these two lower posts and drop towards and ideally into the saucer. &nbsp;But don&rsquo;t be complacent when the ball does go inside the posts towards the saucer; if it doesn&rsquo;t settle smoothly into the saucer, it may become a center drain.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Little Joe [EM - Bally, 1972]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Shoot the upper right saucer all day. &nbsp;Seriously. &nbsp;Lit, it&rsquo;s worth 5000; unlit, it&rsquo;s still worth 3000. &nbsp;Beats anything else you can do for risk-reward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for what the other stuff on the game does &hellip; &nbsp;You get a white dice value from the plunge, 1 through 6 at the top lanes. &nbsp;If you get the ball through a gate and re-plunge, the white dice value changes to whatever the new plunge goes through. &nbsp;The yellow dice value advances by one for each hit to a yellow mushroom bumper, going from 6 back to 1 at the end of the cycle. &nbsp;When your combined white + yellow dice total is either 7 or 11, it changes the top right saucer value from 3000 to 5000 and makes going through the upper gate on the right worth 5000 as well. &nbsp;When the combined value is 6, the upper gate is open. &nbsp;When the combined value is 8, going through the upper gate or hitting the standup target to the left of the top #6 lane opens the lower gate. &nbsp;A combined value of 4 lights the extra ball target. &nbsp;When the combined value is 2, 3, 5, 9, 10 or 12 &hellip; nothing happens.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you happen to get the center post up by hitting the marked rollover in the center of the game], try to let the ball drop onto the flippers and rest against the post, then use microflips to get the ball onto the left flipper just high enough to shoot at that top right saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feed is, of course, the kickout from the saucer.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Lizard, aka Pinball Lizard [SS - Game Plan, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD, via any of the left orbit star rollovers, right spinner or center-left saucer (this ejects through a gate to the top), unless you can hit the left 50,000 lane reliably.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Can you hit a tight shot? &nbsp;Really tight? &nbsp;If so, shoot the left 50,000 lane all day from the right flipper, and be rewarded with both big points and a unique screeching sound effect. &nbsp;If not, go for bonus. &nbsp;Base bonus is built by 1000 for each drop target. &nbsp;Completing sets of five lanes (A-B-C top lanes plus D-E return lanes, lane change is not available), shooting the top saucer, or completing both target banks to spell &ldquo;pinball&rdquo; increases the bonus multiplier. &nbsp;The saucer shot is tight, and missed shots at it yield drainy rebounds, so opt for the sides if your accuracy level isn&rsquo;t that high. &nbsp;Maximums are 29K and 5X for 145,000 total. &nbsp;I believe finishing A-B-C also lights the spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I tend to stick with UTAD and ignore the bottom target bank. &nbsp;You should always ignore the two red side standup targets.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Lost World [SS - Bally, 1978]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;get all six letters, then shoot saucers all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Mild bias to Right until you have A and B, then Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;make either the A or B lane. &nbsp;Once you&rsquo;ve played a ball, if your shots to the top through the spinner usually go into one particular lane of the two, try thereafter to get the other lane on future plunges.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Two major things here, bonus and the saucers. &nbsp;The simpler is the saucers - - the value goes up each time you make the shot, 1K-2K-4K-6K-8K-10K, then stays at 10K after one pause for a special. &nbsp;If the kickout from the saucers is good, you can just repeat them all day for lots of points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The bonus method involves hitting all four letter standup targets and the two lanes, A and B, at the top. &nbsp;C+D lights double bonus; C+D+E+F lights triple bonus; add A and B for all six to get 5X bonus. &nbsp;A+B+C+D lights the extra ball captive ball, but that&rsquo;s only worth shooting at if EBs are active. &nbsp;Lanes, the six letter targets and the spinner all advance your base bonus, to a maximum of 29K. &nbsp;By the time you get all six letters via shots at the targets and to the top through the spinner, you&rsquo;ll probably be at least halfway there; don&rsquo;t worry about your base bonus, let it happen. &nbsp;Your maximum overall bonus is 5X29K or 145,000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds are the kickouts from the two saucers; you&rsquo;ll need to determine whether to dead bounce, live catch, hold up a flipper or something else to get control of the ball after one, and they&rsquo;ll likely be different from each side.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Love Bug [EM - Williams, 1970]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;This game is more complex than it looks. &nbsp;It starts as a UTAD game until you&rsquo;ve raised the center post, then switches to micro-flip and standup target shooting at the 1-4 targets, in order, then reverts to UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the add-a-ball version of Doodle Bug.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;make the top saucer. &nbsp;The slings at the top cycle the lit value; you want the 5000 [red arrow on the right] lit when it drops in. &nbsp;If that would require too many cycles from where the light is when you plunge (it&rsquo;s hard to get more than 2 changes), try to get one of the &ldquo;light bumpers&rdquo; features. &nbsp;Lighting the bumpers also lights one of the side lanes to open the bottom right gate (yellow bumpers on lights the left side, green bumpers on lights the right side). &nbsp;The two &ldquo;500 points&rdquo; choices are the least valuable. &nbsp;The top saucer also advances the target light to the next number (#1-#4, see below).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lighting both the yellow and green bumpers lights the center bumper for 1000 and lights both side lanes to open the gate, so if you already have one color lit, getting the other color becomes your best option.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">First things first: &nbsp;keep the ball up top until you have the center post raised, via either of those side lanes. &nbsp;With any luck, you&rsquo;ll get the ball to also go back up into the saucer to light the bumpers and or go through one of the upper side lanes to open the lower right gate. &nbsp;Okay, now let&rsquo;s assume the ball comes back down to the flippers with the center post up. &nbsp;Try to get the ball to settle between the tip of either flipper and the center post. &nbsp;This is harder than you&rsquo;re used to, since if you try the normal &ldquo;hold up the flipper to cradle it&rdquo; technique, the ball will roll up the flipper, over and behind the flipper pivot, and drain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Okay, assume you&rsquo;ve done a drop catch, dead bounce or whatever and you have the ball in position; good. &nbsp;Now, look at the #1 through #4 targets to see which one is lit - - the top saucer may have advanced it beyond target #1, so you&rsquo;ll need to check. &nbsp;You want to collect the 1-4 targets in order. &nbsp;Assuming you still need all four for simplicity, here&rsquo;s the procedure. &nbsp;Microflip the ball back and forth between the flippers until you get it to roll up the right flipper far enough to shoot at the #1 target. &nbsp;Collect #1; if your shot grazes the rubber to the left of the target, that lowers the post and you should then go up top and try to get the post back up.</span><span class="c5 c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Otherwise, get the ball back in that flipper-post nook, then microflip until you get a good shot at the #2 target. &nbsp;Repeat the process for the #3 and #4 targets; you may not need to raise the post in between these since shooting the #2 and #3 targets doesn&rsquo;t lower it, but if you roll over a &ldquo;down post&rdquo; button along the way, try to reactive the post. &nbsp;Of course, you can shoot the #1-4 targets any time even if the post isn&rsquo;t up and should do if you get a clean shot at the next one you need, it&rsquo;s just easier and usually safer to do using the microflip technique. &nbsp;When shooting #4, you might graze the down post rubber to the right of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Caution here regarding microflipping: &nbsp;if you flip too hard, you risk having the ball roll up the opposite flipper, over it and behind it for a drain; unlike most games, there&rsquo;s no return lane rail to protect you. &nbsp;If you sense you flipped too hard and this might happen, flip right away with the other flipper that the ball is now rolling up to prevent a drain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One you have collected all 4 numbers shoot it to start the doodler (or collect the extra ball, if on). &nbsp;Each time you complete the 1 through 4 targets, the doodler value rises by a factor of ten - - 10, 100, 1000 and maxing out at 10000. &nbsp;(On Dipsy Doodle, it&rsquo;s only 10 or 100.) &nbsp;Starting the doodler lowers the center post immediately - - no sitting there with the ball cradled against the post forever while points score! &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t use the open gate for free doodling, either, since when the ball trips the outlane switch before going through the gate, that stops the doodler.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Now, return to your UTAD routine; the idea now that you have your doodler running is to milk the bumpers for as many points as possible while the doodler racks up more points. &nbsp;But the topmost slingshots [the horizontal ones] and the side &ldquo;up post&rdquo; lanes also immediately stop the doodler. &nbsp;For getting the most out of your doodler, you have to hit that center target, then go up top, avoiding the &ldquo;stop doodle bug&rdquo; rollovers en route, and get as much action up there as you can in the interior area between the bumpers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you ever get the doodler value up to 1000 (or 10000; I&rsquo;ve never done 10K), forget about anything other than getting the doodler running! &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll crush anybody else with just a few seconds of doodling at that level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Flipper control: &nbsp;letting the ball dead bounce from one flipper across to the other is NOT always safe here; it may bounce across just above the top of the other flipper and drain out behind it!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As one of the oldest EMs used, Love Bug may suffer more than most games from weak bumpers; while they were intended to be able to bounce the ball back into the top saucer, I&rsquo;ve seen several cases where they&rsquo;re now too weak to do so. &nbsp;Up top more often is a more viable strategy on the game when the bumpers are recently replaced, since you can then potentially advance the target sequence and light the bumpers with such shots.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Lucky Ace [EM &ndash; Williams, 1974]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Shoot the A-K-Q-J-10 standups from both the top and bottom right flippers; shoot the 1000/Special lane next to the upper flipper from the left flippers. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll get the 1 through 9 center rollover disks shooting crosswise at the cards from the upper flipper, although if you just need one or two to finish the set, go ahead and use a bottom flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is one of my favorite games of the mid-70&rsquo;s, and it has more side-to-side action than most games, making it a greater risk-reward challenge than many other games. &nbsp;I like the center 3 by 3 matrix of rollover disks; completing them once lights double bonus, twice lights triple bonus. &nbsp;Base bonus maxes at 10000 and is advanced by either top lane and by the three yellow standup targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Specials are worth 5000 and are earned two ways: &nbsp;completing 1 through 9 three or more times or completing 10-J-Q-K-A and shooting the upper right special lane. &nbsp;Completing the five cards also lights the return lane on the right for an extra ball; on this add-a-ball version, you can build the balls-to-play count up to 10 using this lane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Historical note: &nbsp;this was the game where I first started shooting the ball up the opposite return lane frequently, for the obvious reason of scoring the extra balls. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d used that shot before - - I think Granada (1972) was the first case - - but not as a primary strategy until this game. &nbsp;The technique is now called Shatzing, in honor of Neil Shatz. &nbsp;In the 1990s, Neil became such an expert at applying this technique on more games than pretty much anyone else, and with greater accuracy, that the technique began to get referred to by his name. &nbsp;While I learned this shot a few decades earlier, I never quite reached his degree of proficiency at it. &nbsp;If you ever see the initials &ldquo;NES&rdquo; on a game for high score, that&rsquo;s for Neil - - either he did it, or one of us who respect him put in his initials instead of our own in tribute to him. &nbsp;I think they even use NES for one of the preset high scores on Iron Maiden, and perhaps on other games as well. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s a great guy; I hope you have a chance to meet him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for the 1-9 targets, crosswise shots using the upper flipper are a good way to collect those, and you will usually get a card at the same time. &nbsp;The rebound off the card standups usually falls down towards one of the flippers rather than making it all the way across to the right outlane, although it can arc down the center at times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">From the lower flippers, shoot up the Special lane or into the cards. &nbsp;Shooting the 1-9 disks is a bit risky since after the ball goes over them it will probably hit and trigger one of the bumpers, which can lead to a drain down the center or either side.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Lucky Hand [EM - Gottlieb, 1977]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Two choices. &nbsp;Choice 1 is to complete the drop target card hands indicated as efficiently as possible to get to Royal Flush, then keep completing those five cards. &nbsp;Choice 2 is UTAD, hoping to complete all four top lanes and then get the ball into them again when they are lit for &ldquo;Wow&rdquo; (50K).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the add a ball version of Jacks Open with different scoring. &nbsp;Finishing the top 4 lanes lights them for &ldquo;Wow&rdquo; which scores 50,000 points. &nbsp;The side and return lanes are worth 1110 instead of 1000; I believe this is the only pinball machine ever made with such identical 3-reel scoring for any feature.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;get one of the four suit lanes at the top. &nbsp;Uncollected lanes are the ones lit and are worth 5000; already-collected lanes are unlit and worth 500. &nbsp;Given a choice on the plunge, take one of the center ones since it&rsquo;s easier to get the side ones during game play.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The drop target value increases as you complete more lanes at the top. &nbsp;Drops are worth 1000 + 1000 per completed suit lane. &nbsp;Here&rsquo;s where Lucky Hand&rsquo;s scoring causes a strategy change from the Jacks Open replay version. &nbsp;With &ldquo;Wows&rdquo; worth 50K, you don&rsquo;t want to &ldquo;milk&rdquo; the drop targets. &nbsp;You want to finish each hand as quickly as possible to get to Royal Flush. &nbsp;You get 5000 points for completing the next &ldquo;hand,&rdquo; e.g. the two jacks, then the three queens, then the kings-queens full house, then the royal flush. &nbsp;Once you complete the Royal Flush, though, it lights the targets to score a 50K Wow. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s your big points on this game, repeating Wows.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lucky Hand encourages you to think &ldquo;flow&rdquo; and &ldquo;dead bounce&rdquo; a lot. &nbsp;When the ball rolls down a return lane, it will often be going too slow to transfer across to the other flipper, yet too fast to cradle. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll need to be ready to shoot on the fly. &nbsp;If the ball is inbound towards a flipper at an angle and you hold up the flipper to get it to roll up the wire guide, it may roll right on up and out the drain at the outer end of the wire guide. &nbsp;That makes cradling not as easy as on modern games. &nbsp;Dead bouncing is the best way to get to a cradle. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll have plenty of opportunity to do dead bounces off shots to the drop targets but be careful: &nbsp;a too-fast dead bounce will also roll up and out the gap above the flippers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The top four suit lanes also light corresponding lanes at the bottom; more lights, more points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When the ball is headed out one of the side lanes, you can often still save it with a well-timed nudge as it gets to the post below the outer edge of the bottom of the lane. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t nudge too soon!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Lucky Seven [SS &ndash; Williams, 1978]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Up top through the almost-useless spinner to advance bonus and change the reels. &nbsp;When reel value is high, shoot the drop targets to collect it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Bias Left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is advanced 3000 at a time by the four top lanes, two return lanes and upper left standup target. &nbsp;Bonus goes up to 30K, so you only need 10 advances to max it out. &nbsp;Bonus can be doubled to 60K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The game&rsquo;s primary scoring, other than bonus, is based on the current &ldquo;reel value&rdquo; like on Williams&rsquo; Jackpot from 1971. &nbsp;The symbols on the three reels change when you score the corresponding color-aligned top lanes or center standup targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You collect the reel value by completing the two drop targets on the sides of the game. &nbsp;To double your bonus, you need exactly one or two clovers among the three symbols. &nbsp;One clover scores 5K; 2 clovers earns 10K; 3 clovers 20K and an extra ball if enabled; three horseshoes is 20K; three diamonds or three sevens is 30K. &nbsp;Other combinations of symbols score nothing other than the 1000 for hitting each drop target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Either of the return lanes will light the spinner, but even lit it&rsquo;s only worth 100.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy is to shoot the drop targets whenever the reel value is 20K or 30K, otherwise go up top to build bonus. &nbsp;Once your bonus is high enough, shoot the reel targets when the double bonus light is on. &nbsp;If you need to change exactly one reel to get to a desired combination, shoot the necessary center standup target. &nbsp;Otherwise, avoid those targets since rebounds off them or misses risk draining. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;ve maxed and doubled your bonus, it&rsquo;s spinner to the top all day except when that reel value is 20K or 30K.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Magic [SS - Stern, 1979]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Spinners all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Mild bias Left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;make the &ldquo;A&rdquo; to light the spinner add-on [see below] and have the ball deflect off the top bumper towards the drop targets. &nbsp;Only the top bumper is worth 1000 and a bonus advance; the other bumpers are just 100 points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Spinners are big here, both for the points they can give and for where the ball goes when shot through them. &nbsp;Shots through the right spinner go up top, to get another letter in M-A-G-I-C and a bonus advance. &nbsp;Shots through the left spinner are deflected around towards the upper drop target three-bank, which scores points and increases the bonus multiplier when completed by one level from 1X up to a maximum of 5X.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing MAGIC increases the spinner value and lights Extra Ball if enabled [collect EB through the left spinner]. &nbsp;Besides increasing when you complete MAGIC, the spinner lights for an extra 1K per spin every other shot through the top center &ldquo;A&rdquo; lane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Magic has a collect bonus hole that you can&rsquo;t directly shoot; it&rsquo;s tucked behind a wedge-shaped section at the upper left of the playfield. &nbsp;You can shoot the ball in the vicinity and hope the bumpers knock it in, but that&rsquo;s about it. &nbsp;Bonus goes up to 19K times 5X or 95,000 maximum.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Don&rsquo;t bother shooting the four standup GICM targets along the sides of the game. &nbsp;Yes, they are letters in MAGIC, but they&rsquo;re not worth the drain risk; take what letters you get from the spinners and random bounces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A subtle scoring rule on the return lanes: &nbsp;the little red star rollover in the center of the playfield just above the flippers raises the return lanes&rsquo; values from 2K to 4K, 6K and then 8K. &nbsp;The return lanes also give two bonus advances, and are shatzable, though watch out for the inlane-outlane drain when trying that.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Magic City

few times, so here&rsquo;s a quick summary. &nbsp;Skill Shot is to hit the top &ldquo;advance and on bumpers&rdquo; rollover, then drop down into the lane for a M-A-G-I-C letter you don&rsquo;t yet have. &nbsp;Then it&rsquo;s UTAD; you want to try to nudge the ball off the top of the three upper bumpers so that it goes up one of the MAGIC letters and then down another one. &nbsp;There are two reasons for this: &nbsp;first, those magic lanes are worth 100 points each, the highest value on the game. &nbsp;Second, once you finish MAGIC, you want to hit the center standup target to get the star. &nbsp;Getting the star lights the upper blue bumper for 100, which then becomes your top UTAD goal. &nbsp;You can try shooting at the center target right away to advance your magic letters towards the star, but rebounds and misses can be dangerous; exercise caution on that approach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">C-I-T-Y is useless other than for replays and extra balls, which

Gottlieb, 1974]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: Choice of UTAD or center semicircle three times, then saucer all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Magnatron is a basic bonus-build game with a booster shot added.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill shot: &nbsp;make the center A lane; it&rsquo;s the only place to get the A. &nbsp;You can get B and C via the return lanes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus goes up to 15K, earned by the uppermost side lanes, the outlanes, the A, B and C side standup targets when you&rsquo;ve lit that letter and the center saucer. &nbsp;Light the standup targets by making the corresponding lettered lane, either at the top or in the return lanes. &nbsp;While you can&rsquo;t shoot at the upper side chutes directly, the ball can easily get deflected into them from the bumpers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center semicircle shot will give you five bonus advances if you knock the captive ball around to the opposite side. &nbsp;Three shots and your bonus is at maximum.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center saucer shot opens the ball save gate at the right outlane. &nbsp;It scores 1000 to start and goes up 1K each time you shoot it up to 5K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unlike most games, this one has two &ldquo;close gate&rdquo; switches &ndash; balls through either return lane close your gate, as does using it. &nbsp;This makes shooting for the saucer to open the gate less valuable than on other machines.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Double bonus is awarded on the last ball and cannot be scored on other balls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy comes down to your accuracy and the way balls come down from the top. &nbsp;If the rebounds from captive ball shot are safe, that&rsquo;s the fastest way to build bonus. &nbsp;If not, UTAD is the alternative, but here, your risk is how the ball will eventually fall down from the top. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll need to carefully watch how balls roll off the rubbers above the semicircle to the rubbers on each side of that and then down towards the flippers or center drain. &nbsp;Once your bonus is maximized, you &nbsp;have a similar decision: &nbsp;faster points at the saucer or slower but maybe safer points up top. &nbsp;What you don&rsquo;t want to do is ever shoot at the lettered standup targets; those get you into side-to-side bounces that risk draining.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Mariner [EM - Bally, 1971]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;shoot the center yellow mushroom bumper to raise the center post. &nbsp;Keep hitting that bumper so long as its value is at least 3000. &nbsp;If bumper value is less than that, shoot up top on the outside of the bumpers. &nbsp;When up top, try to get the ball to enter either side chute.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">An interesting game despite its rather basic optimal strategy. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a bonus to build up, but it can only be collected during your ball - - no end of ball bonus. There are three ways to collect it: &nbsp;the top saucer, the right side chute entered from the top by the bumpers, and that same chute entered by a narrow channel near its lower end. &nbsp;Bonus is built up by hitting either of the two green mushroom bumpers, either top white rollover button, and either indicated standup target. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Skill Shot is to plunge hard enough for the ball to go back and forth over the top white rollers to add a bonus or two, then drop into the top center saucer to collect it. &nbsp;Bonus resets to 1000 when collected and maxes out at 10,000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When the ball is in the top bumper area you want to nudge to try to get it to enter either the left hand feature award chute or the right hand collect bonus chute. &nbsp; The left one exits to a fairly safe feed to the flipper, and the right one is kicked back to the top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The left chute has four possible awards, those available at any given moment are indicated by lights. &nbsp;&ldquo;Up post&rdquo; raises the center post between the flippers. &nbsp;&ldquo;Open gate&rdquo; opens the gate at the right outlane to return the ball to the plunger lane. &nbsp;&ldquo;Light blue bumpers&rdquo; raises their value from 10 to 100 points. &nbsp;&ldquo;Light extra ball&rdquo; lights the standup target for it on the right outside the lower end of the chute. &nbsp;The awards cycle on and off with 10 point switches, but the pattern is non-linear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center yellow up post bumper is the safest route to a good score, but it&rsquo;s tricky. &nbsp;Even if you hit it, the rebound may go over one of the two &ldquo;down post&rdquo; rollovers above the bottom slingshots, reopening the center drain. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s worth a value from 1K to 5K as indicated by the lights below it; the value also cycles on 10 point switches, but like the left chute, the pattern is non-linear, although portions of it go in sequence. &nbsp;If it&rsquo;s worth 5k when you first hit it but the rebound hits one of the bottom slings before you can cradle up, the value may have dropped to 1k. &nbsp;This is different than Time Zone, where the value holds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You want to nudge your way to a controlled shot to raise the post, then try to cradle up again. &nbsp;The best way to do this is to make the shot, then so long as the ball doesn&rsquo;t hit a down post button or drain on the rebound, let it settle between the center post and a flipper. &nbsp;Use microflips to get the ball to just enough height above the opposite flipper to raise that flipper to cradle it. &nbsp;Now, you can shoot the center post again or go up top. &nbsp;I tend to shoot the post when it&rsquo;s worth 3k or more, and to go up top when it&rsquo;s only 1k or 2k. &nbsp;The other thing to consider is how much bonus you&rsquo;ve built up. &nbsp;At 10K in bonus, I may go up top at 3k or 4k to try get the ball into the right-side chute to cash in. &nbsp;After all, there&rsquo;s no guarantee that a shot at the center post won&rsquo;t drain on the rebound.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Mars Trek [EM - Sonic, 1977]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD to maximize bonus, then collect in saucer on right, repeat. &nbsp;Go for the center target to activate double bonus if you only need the letter it&rsquo;s then lit for.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Frequently used in tournaments, Mars Trek is another bonus-heavy game, but one with challenging angles. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s get to it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Skill Shot is usually to get the top saucer for a bonus advance, but that may not be the case depending on the kickout from that saucer and where the ball goes if it instead drops through the top R or T lane. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll be going up top most of the time on this game, so pay close attention to these three key feeds! &nbsp;When the ball goes down the R or T, it travels down-and-left along the rubber below them, usually hits the back of triangular piece behind the center target, then rolls towards the MARS targets. &nbsp;It will either hit one of those targets or the wall or posts between them. &nbsp;If it then rebounds down the center, you want to avoid the lane it went through leading up to all that. &nbsp;The ball will be moving faster when going through the T than through the R [longer fall], so it will bounce in different places for each letter. &nbsp;The bounce will also vary some from shot to shot. &nbsp;If the machine is reasonably nudgeable, you can compensate to some degree, so one or both letters may still be safe with good nudging.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The saucer kickout, meanwhile, may go between the red bumper and the R lane and somewhat towards the lower right slingshot. &nbsp;If it hits the slingshot or the post on top of it in a way that regularly deflects the ball to someplace you can control it, good. &nbsp;Ideally, whenever you send the ball up top, you want it to come down through whichever of these three routes is safest. &nbsp;It can also come down on either side of the red bumper without getting any of those three, but this gets really random, so you&rsquo;ll just have to deal with those cases as best you can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus maxes out at 100,000. &nbsp;It is advanced via the top saucer [which also spots T or R], the E and K return lanes, the star rollover at the upper left, and the spinner behind the saucer on the right. &nbsp;Scoring both E and K doubles your end-of-ball bonus, but NOT the value of the collect bonus saucer [see below]. &nbsp;Besides the return lanes, E and K are shootable via the center target which alternates between them. &nbsp;The catch is, that center shot is risky, with rebounds often draining out the left side [the target is angled facing left]. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;ve finished T-R-E-K, the center target is worth 10000, but I still wouldn&rsquo;t shoot at it then due to that rebound angle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy is UTAD until you&rsquo;ve maxed your bonus, except that if you happen to get the E or K and have the center target lit for the other one, shoot it to get your doubler. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a collect bonus saucer up the right side, with that spinner-in-a-horseshoe behind it. &nbsp;Once your bonus is maxed, you have a decision to make: &nbsp;to shoot the Collect Bonus saucer or not. &nbsp;Unlike most games with a collect bonus feature, you often don&rsquo;t want to shoot at this! &nbsp;If you&rsquo;ve made no progress on the E-K doubler, it&rsquo;s an easy choice to cash in and try to rebuild your bonus. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re at 100K, however, it&rsquo;s a tough call since the collect bonus is NOT doubled. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re then taking a sure 200K [if you don&rsquo;t tilt] and trading it for 100K plus whatever you might earn for the remainder of the ball in play [well, 110K, you&rsquo;re spotted back one bonus when you collect]. &nbsp;You need to consider where you stand versus your opponents and what ball in play you&rsquo;re on to make a wise choice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Flipper technique: &nbsp;don&rsquo;t flip with the third, upper right flipper except to try to deflect the ball in a safer direction than its current path. &nbsp;The M-A-R-S targets across from it are not worth the rebound risk to hit, and a missed shot may drain out the left side. &nbsp;[You do get 10000 if you finish all four MARS targets].</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Mata Hari [SS - Bally, 1978]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;up top through the center to get the top saucer until your bonus multiplier is 5X. &nbsp;If extra balls and specials have been set to be worth points, then shoot the A and B orbits all day. &nbsp;If not, shoot drop targets all day. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Before deciding on a strategy, check two things. &nbsp;First, do extra balls and specials awards points? &nbsp;If they do, then the A-B shots become big, easy points once you&rsquo;ve completed them 5 times on a ball. &nbsp;Second, how is the kickout from the top saucer? &nbsp;If it&rsquo;s consistently safe, e.g. the ball falls to the left flipper and you can let it dead bounce over to the right flipper to get to a cradle, shoot for the saucer until you have maxed your bonus at 5X. &nbsp;If the kickout is bad, e.g. SDTM [not uncommon, unfortunately], ignore the saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for what the saucer does, the first shot scores 3,000, the second 3,000 plus lights double bonus, the third 3,000 plus lights 3X bonus, the fourth 3K plus 5X bonus. &nbsp;The second (2X) saucer shot also lights the left outlane for 50k, and &ldquo;correct drains&rdquo; here can win games. &nbsp;The third (3X) shot lights both outlanes. &nbsp;If the saucer shot kickout isn&rsquo;t too nasty, you would do well to at least get to 3X to light the outlanes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once you&rsquo;ve either maxed out your bonus multiplier or determined that the saucer is unsafe to shoot, you need to choose between shooting drop targets and shooting A-B orbits. &nbsp;The orbits are the better choice if shots to them often go all the way around, i.e. up one orbit and down the other, scoring both. &nbsp;If not, try the drop targets and see how safe the rebounds off them are before making a serious effort at the orbits. &nbsp;A set of eight completed drop targets scores 50K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The best time to shoot A-B is once you&rsquo;ve already raised its value to EB or Special and those both award points. &nbsp;In that case, it only takes 2 shots to score the special points; one shot if the ball goes up one orbit and across and down the other!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Targets and lanes advance your base bonus up to 29,000, so max overall bonus is 5X times 29K or 145,000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;besides the saucer kickout, do balls coming down the orbits roll cleanly towards the flippers, or do they skim off of the slingshots?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Medusa [SS &ndash; Bally, 1981]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;UTAD to shoot top targets and the saucer when lit to collect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill shot: &nbsp;Soft plunge to match the moving light sequence on the star rollovers; the value of the spinner between the small upper flippers goes up 500 per light hit up to 2500 max. &nbsp;Soft plunges also usually stay in the upper playfield; a full plunge will whip down the left orbit to the lower playfield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We&rsquo;ll do the upper playfield first. &nbsp;The top target bank presents you with a steadily increasing number of targets. &nbsp;The sequence, counting the seven from left to right, goes #4 (center); #3 &amp; #5; 1-4-7; 1-3-5-7; 1-3-4-5-7; 1-2-3-5-6-7; 1 through 7. &nbsp;The upper flippers zip closed for about 10 seconds when you finish a set of targets; hit more targets to extend that time. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s some messy math involved in how much you need to do to light the saucer to collect Olympus Bonus; for simplicity, just keep shooting drops. &nbsp;About every two sets, the saucer will light for collect. &nbsp;If you hit the two outer stand-up targets behind the drop targets (will light yellow arrows), your progress speed doubles. &nbsp;Progress is reduced one step each time you hit the center stand-up target, so don&rsquo;t! &nbsp;Collect values are in 50K increments up to 200K. &nbsp;The more targets you hit, the higher your collect value gets, but shoot it as soon as you light it. &nbsp;The collect value does not reset, but you will need to continue to hit targets to relight it to collect again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you advance the top bonus past the lit LED above three times and then shoot the saucer, you earn extended play at the end of your game. &nbsp;During extended play, shoot the main playfield 3-bank and 4-bank for both points and more time; time is displayed on the left side of the playfield digital display. &nbsp;Once your time is at zero, you can still play until the ball drains.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Besides timing out, the upper zipped flippers will open whenever the ball comes down either orbit to the main playfield. &nbsp;This is so you can shoot the ball back up top through the spinner between the now-open upper flippers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The main playfield is primarily concerned with a normal &ldquo;Medusa&rdquo; bonus and a Colossus Bonus. &nbsp;Medusa bonus base is built by lower playfield drop targets and stand-up targets, star rollovers in the plunger lane and near the outlanes, and the outlanes. &nbsp;Base bonus goes up to 99K; threshold values of 20K, 40K, 60K and 80K are preserved, residual bonus resets. &nbsp;Bonus multiplier is advanced to 2X, 3X and 5X by shooting the left orbit. &nbsp;At 5X, the orbit becomes worth 50K. &nbsp;Bonus multiplier resets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hit the left 1-2-3 standup targets in sequence or the right four drop targets in any order to advance and collect &ldquo;Colossus&rdquo; bonus. &nbsp;The value goes from 30K to 150K in 30K increments.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The lower flippers are standard size but are transparent and tinted red. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re lit when not flipping. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll find they don&rsquo;t &ldquo;feel&rdquo; like normal flippers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The right orbit scores successively 10K, 20K, 30K, 40K and 50K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s a &ldquo;Shield of the Gods&rdquo; post between the flippers, operated by a separate button above the right flipper button. &nbsp;It will kick the ball upward when triggered. &nbsp;You get 5 kicks to start and can earn more via orbit shots. &nbsp;Any unused ones score 10K each after every ball. &nbsp;The right digital counter in the playfield shows how many you have left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The outlanes are irregularly configured, with posts next to curved return lanes instead of a vertical wire divider. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll need some practice to get the hang of nudging to keep the ball alive in there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While I list this game as UTAD, all three types of bonus can be lucrative, as can the right orbit and, if lit for high value, the center spinner. &nbsp;Doing a bit of everything is fine, but of course the ball is always safest when up top.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Melody [EM - Gottlieb, 1967]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;hit the center target to light the bumper, then either UTAD or, if able, left saucer all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the add-a-ball version of Sing Along.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing numbers 1-2-3-4 is good [1&rsquo;s, 2&rsquo;s and 3&rsquo;s score 50, the 4&rsquo;s score 100]; getting lots of saucer collects is better. &nbsp;The saucers kick out from one to another left to right until the right one kicks the ball towards the right flipper. &nbsp;If you can, try to flip from the kickout into the left saucer to repeat the process; if not, UTAD. &nbsp;Ignore the bottom &ldquo;3&rdquo; targets unless they&rsquo;re the only ones you need to complete a color set (see below). &nbsp;Hit the center 100-point standup target to light the bumpers. &nbsp;If the ball goes through the 50-point &ldquo;bumpers off&rdquo; gate between the upper bumpers, relight the bumpers with the center target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s a center post between the two central outlanes; use it and try not to flip then - - if you do and you mis-time your flip, you&rsquo;ll drain either down the center or under the flipper. &nbsp;If you do get the ball stuck under a flipper [between the tip of the flipper and the larger posts below the tips], try to do a rapid multiple flip to get the ball to bounce off of the large post and back into play. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll find that down the middle drains are less common on Melody than on some other similar center post games because the way the ball rattles around between the center post and the pair of posts below the flipper tips makes it bounce within reach of a flipper tip save more often.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Saucers score 10 + 10 per lit number of that color. &nbsp;If you have all four numbers of a color lit, the hole awards an extra ball, if enabled. &nbsp;For instance, the top left &ldquo;1&rdquo; lane, far left central &ldquo;2&rdquo; lane, left side &ldquo;3&rdquo; standup and left &ldquo;4&rdquo; outlane, once collected, lights the left hole/saucer for an add-a-ball. &nbsp;If add-a-balls are on, completing color sets can become your top priority.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Memory Lane [EM - Stern, 1978]</span></p><p

early Sterns, this is a spinners game. &nbsp;Not only do they generate spinner points, they also can get you your bonus multipliers and top saucer points. &nbsp;The spinners are lit by the return lanes, but each lane lights the one on the </span><span class="c5 c17">same</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;side of the machine, not the </span><span class="c17 c5">opposite</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;side as is more common on Bally and Gottlieb games. &nbsp;You need to transfer the ball across to shoot the lit spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus can be large. &nbsp;The ten bowling pin formation rollover buttons each score a pin; get all ten for a strike. &nbsp;Stay alert when the ball is rolling over the buttons; they deflect the ball and you may need a last second nudge to avoid draining. &nbsp;Bonus is 1000 per pin and 10K per strike, up to 80K (7 strikes and 10 pins) total. &nbsp;Bonus is doubled by making the top left saucer; after you make that, the top center saucer lights for triple bonus. &nbsp;Strikes and pins carry over; multipliers reset. &nbsp;Each saucer is worth 5K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shots through the left spinner often zip right through the saucer to the top, so it may take several tries to get double bonus. &nbsp;Not a problem, you want to shoot the spinner anyway. &nbsp;Balls up top often fail to go in the center saucer, too; don&rsquo;t sweat it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center drop target bank alternates lit or not on slingshot hits. &nbsp;When you hit a target, the bank stays on or off until you complete it or the ball ends. &nbsp;If you complete it when lit, you score 3K and a strike; unlit, all you get is the 500 points for each target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since the spinners are important, try to shatz the return lanes to light them both early on. &nbsp;The curved lane wires make this not too difficult; just watch out for up-and-out drains.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Meteor [SS - Stern, 1979]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;knock down the M, R and all but one of the E-T-E-O Meteor letter targets, then shoot the spinner all day. &nbsp;Whenever you complete Meteor and the targets reset, get them again, then back to the spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is one of the more spinner-heavy games you&rsquo;ll ever find. &nbsp;The spinner is worth 200 points plus 200 per letter target down in Meteor for the letters E-T-E-O and 600 extra for the M and the R. &nbsp;If you have M-E-T-O-R, for instance, you get 200+600+200+200+200+600 or 2,000 per spin! &nbsp;Finishing all six letters resets the Meteor letter drop target bank and reduces the spinner value back to 200.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Each time you complete Meteor, you also raise your bonus X by one up to a max of 7X. &nbsp;Bonus is built from the numbered target banks, 1, 2 and 3, 1000 for each target up to 7 total. &nbsp;Completing a numbered target bank also awards the current value of that bank, i.e. how high your bonus for that number is (unmultiplied). &nbsp;Maximum end of ball bonus is 147K (1000*7*3*7), but whenever your ending bonus multiplier is 6X or 7X, it resets to single bonus for the next ball. &nbsp;For 1X to 5X, the multiplier is held. &nbsp;Meteor targets downed during a ball are remembered, while the 1-2-3 banks all reset each ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">My general strategy is UTAD: &nbsp;spinner from the left flipper, with the occasional center shot for the &ldquo;R&rdquo; in Meteor when the spinner value is low; bank shot off the #2 drop targets from the right flipper. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t worry about accidentally completing the Meteor letters, even if I have the optimal five lit, for three reasons. &nbsp;First, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to knock them down again to get your spinner back up close to its maximum. &nbsp;Second, the Meteor targets themselves are good value - - 2000 each for E-T-E-O and 6000 each for the M and the R, or a total of 20K per set. &nbsp;Third, that bonus multiplier advance I mentioned earlier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The lit return lanes spot a Meteor letter, too, so you&rsquo;ll often finish the set by accident when the ball goes through there. &nbsp;The lanes present an opportunity for strategic shatzing: &nbsp;if you have 3 or 4 letters and the ball cradled on the right flipper, you can try shatzing the ball to the left flipper. &nbsp;This will both set up a spinner shot and potentially collect another letter or two, increasing your spinner value if your alley pass goes up far enough to trip the return lane switch. &nbsp;Just don&rsquo;t shatz too hard, you can get an up-the-inlane, down-the-outlane drain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for the 1 and 3 banks, I ignore them, since you&rsquo;ll collect some by accident making saves or via slingshot bounces. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll shoot for the number 2 bank at the upper left if the ball is coming down the right return lane too fast to trap but too slowly to pass it to the left flipper. &nbsp;That will both add bonus and get the ball up near the Meteor letters; you&rsquo;ll usually want to nudge one way or another after the ball bounces off the #2 targets to try to get it to deflect towards the Meteor letters or the top of the bumper below them. &nbsp;If I have the ball cradled on the right flipper and the letters I need up top are the middle ones, I&rsquo;ll sometimes shoot to thread the ball between the bumper and the upper flipper. &nbsp;That shot is riskier, though, since a miss can hit either the bumper or the post below the upper flipper and rebound downwards toward draining. &nbsp;Observe that the gap to the left of the bumper is much wider than to the right, making that the outside shot the easier route to the top from the right flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Meteor is a great game for practicing ball transfer techniques, since it&rsquo;s so important to get the ball on the left flipper. &nbsp;Plus the sound of a good spinner rip is really satisfying.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Mini Pool [EM - Gottlieb, 1969]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD, ideally via a bank shot off a lit standup target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Two main goals: &nbsp;collect the 10 numbers, then shoot lit targets (worth 3000 vs. 500 unlit); and get the bumper lit for 1000 points and hit it as often as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Mini Pool is the add-a-ball version of Target Pool, with the point values 10 times higher.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You can&rsquo;t shoot any of the number targets directly, you have to get them via slingshot hits, kicks off of the bumper, or bank shots. &nbsp;Just put the ball up top and let the slings and bumpers do the work, with nudging assists from you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You light the bumper by making the 6, 7 and 8 lanes at the top. &nbsp;Find the Skill Shot for each top lane. &nbsp;Ideally, plunge the 6 first, soft plunge the 8 on the next ball, and get the 7 last to get the sure 1000 points when the ball hits the now-lit bumper after going through it. &nbsp;If and only if the game has strong flippers, you can instead plunge for the 7 lane first. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll find that bank shots to the top of the game off of the side standup targets will sometimes go back up through one of the top lanes. &nbsp;This happens far more often for the 6 and 8 lanes than for the 7 lane. &nbsp;If it does go through to the very top, try to nudge the ball into any other lane you don&rsquo;t already have when it comes back down. &nbsp;But it does mean that it&rsquo;s possible to get the bumper lit on the first ball, which is a huge scoring advantage on this game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Numbers 1-5 are collected from either of the two standups for each number on the upper sides. &nbsp;The 6 you get from the top left lane and left return lane; 7 from the top center lane and either outlane; 8 from the top right lane and right return lane. &nbsp;The 9 and 10 are the two hard-to-see standup targets between the bottom of the top center lane and either top side lane. &nbsp;Collecting all 10 numbers adds a ball and lights the return lanes and outlanes for extra balls, too. &nbsp;Collecting numbers also lights some of the 15 (!) standup arrow targets for 3000 instead of 500 points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball control: &nbsp;the inlanes usually will feed the ball down fast enough to transfer it to the other flipper; do so if there are lit arrows you can shoot from the other side but not from the return lane side. &nbsp;Likewise, use dead bounces and catches to get the ball to the shoot-lit side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In general, shoot the ball up top all the time and don&rsquo;t bother to shoot the arrows on the center bank unless they&rsquo;re lit. &nbsp;Going topside gives you a chance to light the bumper if it&rsquo;s not lit, to hit it if it is, and to collect more numbers to light more arrows.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2">Drain shots: &nbsp;The standup targets on the right and left ends of the center bank. &nbsp;The ONLY time you should ever shoot one of these is if all three of these are true:</span></p><p class="c12 c14"><span class="c2">1. &nbsp; it&rsquo;s lit for 3000</span></p><p class="c12 c14"><span class="c2">2. &nbsp; you&rsquo;re the final player</span></p><p class="c39 c14"><span class="c2">3. &nbsp;you need less than 3000 points to win</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center bank&rsquo;s center target can be drainy, so don&rsquo;t shoot it even if lit. &nbsp;The other center bank targets tend to be fairly safe, but again, don&rsquo;t shoot for one unless it&rsquo;s lit for 3000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Nudging: &nbsp;You want to nudge up top at times to get the ball to hit the upper slings hard enough to get a good kick off of them and score number targets; this calls for a push nudge. &nbsp;You want to do side nudges up top as the ball is approaching the top-bottom divider necks [edges of the slings above and center target bank below] to get the ball to come down from the top along the face of the lower slingshots</span><span class="c5 c9">.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp; The most common drains on the game, besides those two targets I warned you about, are rolling down the sides directly from the upper playfield, slingshot cross-drains on the lower playfield, and soft downward bounces off of the arrow targets near the neck that go down the middle. &nbsp;When you see that the ball is coming down and is either going to hit one of these targets or hit a slingshot too softly to trigger it and then roll into one of the arrow standups, try to gauge the angle of attack. &nbsp;You want the ball to bounce off the arrow target and go parallel to the lower slingshot close enough to it so that the ball rolls down its face to the flipper without triggering the slingshot.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Miss-O [EM &ndash; Williams, 1969]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot is the center lane for 200 points. &nbsp;While the ball is up in the bumpers, try to nudge it into hitting the top left &ldquo;A&rdquo; and top right &ldquo;D&rdquo; yellow standup targets to light the bumpers. &nbsp;After that, shoot the center horseshoe shot [500 points] when you can, go up top when you can&rsquo;t. &nbsp;The horseshoe shot is pretty narrow, so if you&rsquo;re not sure you&rsquo;re accurate enough, stick with UTAD. &nbsp;Likewise, if the feed when the ball comes out of the horseshoe is bad, avoid it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Balls can and do sometimes come back up into play after dropping into the zone around the bottom center bumper. &nbsp;Try not to flip when the ball is in there unless the ball is clearly above the edge of the flipper [in the unpainted wood area]. &nbsp;If you flip at the wrong time, the ball can drain under the flipper for zero points. If it drains down one of the three center lanes [ideally the middle one], at least you&rsquo;ll get points. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Monaco [EM - Segasa, 1977]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD left side through the spinner to fill up your bonus; UTAD right side to the saucer to collect bonus. &nbsp;Rinse and repeat. &nbsp;Ignore the two lower saucers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right, to build bonus, score the spinner and get top lane points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Here&rsquo;s another case where settings matter. &nbsp;First, let&rsquo;s get acquainted with the game&rsquo;s features.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The primary goal of the game is to build bonus, then collect it. &nbsp;You build bonus four ways: &nbsp;by shooting the left spinner; by scoring a lit lane at the top; by hitting a lit stand up target; or by draining through a side outlane. &nbsp;Only one top lane and one stand up target are lit at any time; they alternate on switch hits, and are opposite-paired, i.e. the top right lane and the left target light together, alternating with top left lane and the right stand up target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus goes up to 100K in increments of 10K. &nbsp;You collect it by shooting the saucer on the far upper right via the long chute below it. &nbsp;The spinner value is tied to the bonus value: &nbsp;it&rsquo;s only worth 100 most of the time, but whenever your bonus is at 100K, it&rsquo;s worth 1000 per spin. &nbsp;If you collect the bonus, the spinner value resets to 100.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Now it&rsquo;s time for the settings question. &nbsp;Monaco has a swinging target right in the center of the playfield that sets up double bonus in an odd way. &nbsp;On the standard Monaco setup, you need to hit the swinging target when it&rsquo;s in each of the two &ldquo;1&rdquo; or &ldquo;3&rdquo; positions [right side and left side, one indicator light for each of the two positions; center positions don&rsquo;t come into play here] to activate double bonus. &nbsp;On most machines, I advise people to go for bonus multipliers. &nbsp;On Monaco, I say, not necessarily. &nbsp;The rebound off of the swinging target often drains, or you may miss your shot at it and have the rebound drain. &nbsp;I think it&rsquo;s too risky a shot to be worthwhile most of the time. &nbsp;If you already have half of your doubler by accident, then it&rsquo;s more worth considering. &nbsp;However, I was at a recent tournament where the game was set so that just one hit to the target in the &ldquo;1&rdquo; or &ldquo;3&rdquo; position awarded double bonus. &nbsp;Now, it&rsquo;s a good idea to shoot for it, especially once your bonus is up over 50,000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Like Mars Trek and Cherry Bell, among other games, Monaco poses the question of bonus collect-or-not. &nbsp;For Monaco, the decision turns out to be easier due to the way the spinner scores. &nbsp;Here&rsquo;s the deal. &nbsp;If you shoot the bonus collect, your bonus is scored - - without the doubling - - and your bonus is reset to 10K. &nbsp;If you have the double bonus </span><span class="c17 c5">already</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;activated, your playing strategy needs to reflect that. &nbsp;Collecting bonus without the doubling you can actually </span><span class="c17 c5 c9">lose</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;points if you drain before you can &ldquo;refill&rdquo; your bonus. &nbsp;For example, if you have 100K bonus built up with the doubler lit and collect your bonus at the saucer (resetting your bonus to 10K), but then quickly drain, you&rsquo;ll earn 120K total: &nbsp;the 100K bonus collect plus 2 times the reset-to-10K bonus. &nbsp;If you hadn&rsquo;t shot to collect bonus and drained instantly, you&rsquo;d have collected 200K as your end of ball bonus. &nbsp;If it&rsquo;s ball 5 and you were behind by 150K at the time, you just changed a win into a loss. &nbsp;Clearly this means that whether or not you should collect bonus depends on the game situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Let&rsquo;s do some math. &nbsp;Assume you have the bonus maxxed out at 100K. &nbsp;You collect 100K. &nbsp;Now, you make make N shots through the spinner (N&lt;=4) at 20 spins per shot. &nbsp;Your new bonus will be 10K + (20K x N). &nbsp;Your spin value, for N less than 5, will be (20x100xN). &nbsp;Total value is 100K + 10K + 20KN + 2KN.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Now do the same calculation if you hadn&rsquo;t collected. &nbsp;Your bonus is still 100K. &nbsp;Your spinner value for the N shots is 20x1000xN or 20KN. &nbsp;So collecting added merely 10K + 2KN, essentially the 10K you got when the bonus reset plus the value of the unlit spins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bottom line is, you get an extra 10K each time you shoot to collect so long as you DON&rsquo;T have double bonus lit and drain before refilling the bonus. &nbsp;In summary:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">If double bonus is lit, never shoot to collect bonus, just keep ripping the spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c5">If double bonus is not lit, feel free to shoot to collect;

a completed set of five is worth 15K while having four of each is worth only 8K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center saucer raises center post; the saucer is worth 500 until you finish the Odd numbers, then it&rsquo;s worth 5000. &nbsp;Top left saucer is likewise worth 500 until you finish the Even numbers, then it&rsquo;s 5000 (plus an extra ball if active). &nbsp;Each saucer spots the lit number &ndash; odd for the center, even for the top, although the number lit may be one you already have. &nbsp;The active number for the top left saucer is shown along the roulette arc below it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When you have the center post up, let the ball settle between it and either flipper, then use micro flips to set up shots. &nbsp;Balls hitting either of the two small white rollover buttons above the tops of the bottom slingshots each put the post back down. &nbsp;The kickout from the center saucer should go to the left flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are two gates on the right side of the machine. &nbsp;They are opened by the mushroom bumpers at the middle of the left side; the top bumper opens the top gate, the bottom mushroom opens the lower gate. &nbsp;Balls through the rights chute behind the gates score 4K if entering through the top gate and 2K if entering through the lower gate. &nbsp;Unlike the center post, the gates stay open for the remainder of the ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Most shots up the left orbit will not enter the upper saucer but continue up to the number rollovers at the top of the machine. &nbsp;Balls go in the left saucer most often from bounces off the left bumper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy: &nbsp;if you get the top gate open, go for that;

three drops down, three advances per lit saucer shot. &nbsp;Only one saucer is lit at a time, changing on 10 point switches. &nbsp;Base value of the saucers is 3000, so you want to shoot them anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s a scoring lane directly below each saucer, and another kicker lane below each of those. Balls landing in the kicker lanes are shot through the middle lane into the saucer (once in a while rattling out). &nbsp;You can score the saucer either directly with a flipper shot, or via getting the ball to drop into a kicker. &nbsp;Balls can enter the kicker either via the gap between the middle lanes and the kicker lanes or from the top of the middle lanes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Maximum base bonus is 15,000. &nbsp;Bonus is doubled on the last ball. &nbsp;If you get all 3 A-B-C letters, you get double bonus on balls 1 to 4 and 4X bonus on ball 5.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds on this machine are the kickouts from the saucers. &nbsp;These may go to the flippers below, or they may hit the edge of the middle side lanes and carom into the bumpers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Mystic [SS - Bally, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;shoot drops to build base bonus, shoot spinners when lit, shoot the captive ball for bonus X once your base bonus is significant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot &ndash; make the top saucer, which lights your spinners [1K per spin vs. just 10 points, so a big deal], plus it spots you a star. &nbsp;The spinner lights toggle on and off with bumper hits even after you activate them, so they&rsquo;re not always lit; pay attention when you have the ball cradled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Getting one of the two top star lanes on the Skill Shot is another possibility, but less useful. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s possible to get nothing out of your Skill Shot since the ball can easily slip past the center saucer; make sure you nudge if you need to! &nbsp;You can also still get the saucer after the ball slips by with a good bounce off one of the bumpers just below, so try to do that, too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is huge here and can be 2/3 or more of your total score. &nbsp;It is advanced via the three banks of three drop targets each on the main playfield. &nbsp;Observe how each target scores a particular tic-tac-toe square, marked on the playfield by the target. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll get either a pyramid or an eye in the corresponding square, depending on which symbol was lit when you hit the target. &nbsp;Each drop target bank has a pair of these symbols near it to tell you which the target will score when hit. &nbsp;10-point switch hits, e.g. the slingshots, toggle which symbol is lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Getting three squares in a row [up, down, or diagonal] of matching pyramid or eye type advances you one bonus circle of 9000, indicated by the values just above the flippers. &nbsp;Filling all nine squares with the same symbol would be eight lines - - three vertical, three horizontal, two diagonal - - getting you a base bonus of 72K. &nbsp;Each square symbol is also worth 3K in end of ball bonus, whether or not it&rsquo;s part of a completed line. &nbsp;Bonus squares from incomplete sets and any circled values are held for the whole game, so it&rsquo;s important to build them early; go for drop targets on ball one. &nbsp; &nbsp;Each target bank resets when it is completed. &nbsp;The squares all reset once you have hit all nine drop targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For a target that already has been scored and has a symbol, if you hit it again with the opposite symbol lit on that target bank, nothing changes; you need to finish all nine blocks in the grid to reset it for another chance to finish lines. If you&rsquo;ve finished all of your lines and also have eight of the nine symbols lit from a second time through, that&rsquo;s 96,000 in base bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For shooting at the drop targets, I find they&rsquo;re not that drainy if you focus on the two side banks and allow rebounds or kicks off of the slingshots to do some of the work on the center bank for you. &nbsp;Save the center bank for last, it&rsquo;s the highest risk of the three. &nbsp;You also can sometimes get a captive ball hit with a bank shot off of the right side target bank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once your bonus is high, it&rsquo;s worth shooting for the captive ball. &nbsp;The first hit scores 5K, the next three hits give you your 2X, 3X and 4X bonus multipliers. Your maximum bonus is 384,000. After that, the captive ball scores a special next [may or may not be worth anything], then 25K per hit thereafter. &nbsp;You can usually get the captive ball with either flipper - - backhands from a cradle on the right should work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing the four star lanes [500 points each], the two at the top and the two return lanes, scores 10K. &nbsp;Two completions lights EB, which may be on or worth points instead. &nbsp;After that, additional completions award a special, again may or may not be worth points. &nbsp;A lit star is one you need, not one you&rsquo;ve collected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;the ball exiting the bumpers and partial spinner shots [through it but not all the way to the top]. &nbsp;While some people treat this as a UTAD game and just keep shooting spinners, you may lose more balls from nasty bumper area exits after top shots than from drop target rebounds. &nbsp;Drop targets and the captive ball is a perfectly good strategy.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Neptune [SS - Gottlieb, 1978]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Complete either all 6 red cards or all 6 black cards, then shoot for the lit &ldquo;wow&rdquo; targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;get a card you need; try for the 10 on ball 1. &nbsp;If you already have all of the red cards, get the center saucer if it&rsquo;s lit to award a black card. &nbsp;If you have all the red cards and the saucer is lit on red, go for the 10 at the middle left to try to get the ball to bounce into the top left kicker.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The goal is to collect all the cards, 6 red and 6 black. &nbsp;All but the black queen can be collected from lanes, although the black ace lane is the right outlane. &nbsp;The top and bottom saucers also award a random card of the color indicated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The game is pretty much UTAD and nudging to get a complete set of one or both card colors. &nbsp;Once you have a set of either color, one card of that color will light for &ldquo;wow,&rdquo; worth 50,000. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s where all the points are on this game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The top left chute is worth a random award of 5k, 10k or 15k when unlit, but ten times one of those when lit. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;ve finished a color and can&rsquo;t directly shoot for a lit card for a wow, try to get the ball into the chute!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Night Rider [EM - Bally, 1976; SS &ndash; Bally, 1977]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version and full version: &nbsp;UTAD through the spinners.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Skill Shot is to get just enough switch hits from the rubbers at the top to get the ball in the saucer when it&rsquo;s worth 5000; it cycles left-to-right on 10-point or 100-point switches. &nbsp;When the top saucer is lit for double bonus, do whatever you can to get it. &nbsp;The instructions do not say what lights it, but it also seems to be controlled by switch hits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ignore the drop targets; while worth 3000 points when completing a bank, they&rsquo;re a drain risk.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Nine Ball [SS - Stern, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;not really!

This is separate from your regular bonus. &nbsp;While the numbered sequence is not quite as valuable as the bonus or loop target can be, shots at the numbered targets often rebound into the center 3-bank, and this is often easier than shooting at that 3-bank directly when the ball isn&rsquo;t cradled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Getting a ball in the left chute behind the number targets both spots numbers and raises the loop target value. &nbsp;Valuable, but impossible to shoot directly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Okay, time for how to lock a ball. &nbsp;You need to have the #5 ball in the bonus diamond lit. &nbsp;This will happen when your bonus is 5K, 14K [9+5], 22K [9+8+5], 29K [9+8+7+5], 35K [9+8+7+6+5] and from then on through 45K. &nbsp;As for getting it locked, that&rsquo;s largely luck, since you have no shot angle on the entry to the lock chute.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Multiball starts one of two ways: &nbsp;lock all three balls;

metal loop instead of a flipper. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Skill Shot is to roll over one of the top white discs that lights either the red bumpers or the yellow bumpers, then have the ball fall into the 500 point saucer. &nbsp;When the ball is ejected from the saucer, it goes down and to the right; you want to hit the &ldquo;grabber&rdquo; button to have the gator metal bar come out of the upper right side to catch the ball as it does so. &nbsp;This scores 1000 points plus a bonus advance for going down the gator lane and feeds the ball towards the right flipper when it comes out of the one-way gate below.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The grabber can also be used as a flipper of sorts: &nbsp;if you trigger it early, before the ball would be trapped inside it, it will push the ball away to the left. &nbsp;If you can tell that the ball won&rsquo;t be rolling quite far enough to the right to get inside the grabber, you might want to do this to change its trajectory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Like all games with zipper flippers, you want to keep them closed as much as possible. &nbsp;And like many other zipper games, it&rsquo;s the center mushroom bumper that closes flippers. &nbsp;On Nip-It, the white rollover disk to the right of the mushroom bumper opens the flippers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s an &ldquo;Open Gate&rdquo; standup target on left side middle, which lights on some funky switch hits cycle (it does not appear to be keyed to any of the scoring reels). &nbsp;If you see it lit, go ahead and shoot it to open the lower right gate, otherwise ignore that target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A ball can be locked in lower right-side saucer, which will score your bonus and feed a second ball to plunger lane. &nbsp;When you get the new ball to the plunger, go for whichever light-bumpers button you haven&rsquo;t already triggered plus the 500 point top saucer again. &nbsp;Grab the ball as it exits, and when it feeds out the bottom of the gator gate, close the flippers if you haven&rsquo;t already done so, then let the ball settle onto them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Now you have a strategy choice to make. &nbsp;One option is to shoot for either &ldquo;release ball&rdquo; target in the upper center of the game to start multiball. &nbsp;Your bonus, maximum 10000, does NOT reset when you lock a ball, so if your bonus is close to 10K, this is a good choice. &nbsp;If you go this route, try to relock a ball to collect your bonus again, then re-release it, etc. to collect your bonus multiple times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The other choice is to shoot the left gate or up top for gator-grab-all-day. &nbsp;This can be done even if you&rsquo;re in multiball if you have a ball cradled on the left flipper and can just keep going into the gate or up top from the right flipper, then catching the ball on it again when it feeds out of the gator. &nbsp;The risk here is that on some Nip-Its, the feed from the gator may drain down the center some of the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Like Gator and other zipper flipper machines, backhand flips may be more accurate or stronger than forehands. &nbsp;As always with zipper flipper games, top priority is to keep the flippers zipped as much as possible and let the ball settle onto the zipped flippers whenever you can to set up controlled shots via microflips. &nbsp;When you have the flippers zipped and start multiball, try to keep one ball settled on the zipped flippers and just knock the other ball around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Final note: &nbsp;locked balls can be stolen by subsequent players &ndash;

the saucer cycles on 10-point with hits between left, right, double, left double, and right double. &nbsp;Shoot the spinner to get the ball to the top for more tries at dropping it into the saucer with one of those useful awards lit. &nbsp;Once you have both arrows, the center saucer stays lit for 3K instead. &nbsp;The double bonus still toggles on and off until you get it. &nbsp;The saucer also lights the spinner for 1K per spin.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Now, the left saucer. &nbsp;You should shoot the left saucer whenever you can to build up its value, even if you&rsquo;re not yet collecting that value yet. &nbsp;The catch here is two-fold: &nbsp;how often do such shots go in the saucer vs. rimming out, and where does the kickout from a successful saucer shot go? &nbsp;If shots tend to rim out or be rejected from being too hard, you need to &ldquo;half-miss&rdquo; your shot: &nbsp;have it graze the edge of the chute leading to the left saucer to slow the ball down, rather than have it go up cleanly with a pure shot. &nbsp;You can also try to time or flutter your flip to take some energy off of the shot.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Key feed: &nbsp;the return from the left saucer, both on shots made </span><span class="c17 c5 c9">and</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;on shots missed. &nbsp;This is probably </span><span class="c17 c5 c9">the</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;most important kickout relative to game scores I can think of. &nbsp;If you can consistently find a way to get the ball cradled back on the right flipper after a saucer kickout so that you can repeat the shot, that&rsquo;s when you blow this game up - - assuming most of your shots to the saucer go in rather than rim out. &nbsp;If the shot rims out, the return will likely be faster than from a made-shot saucer kickout and go further to the right on the machine. &nbsp;Either way, you need to note if either version tends to center drain and prepare to nudge to avoid that and prepare for your ball control tactic from each type of feed.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Collecting all six letters via the two top lanes, two top standup targets, and two return lanes activates a separate bonus feature for 20K [first completion] or 30K [second]. &nbsp;This is preserved from ball to ball, as is progress towards it. &nbsp;This is only awarded as end-of-ball bonus, not top left saucer collects.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">North Star [EM - Gottlieb, 1964]</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5 c9">Quickie version: &nbsp;side saucers all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: get a top lane you don&rsquo;t already have; best to get the center one first.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Each top lane lights the bumper most directly aligned under it; you may be able to get an up and down the lane kick off of the center bumper.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Nudging is very important on this game, and it&rsquo;s almost a total luck box with a tight tilt. &nbsp;Balls easily fall into the drain channels outside of the flippers. &nbsp;When t h e ball is in the lower slingshot area, nudge the game frequently but only as hard as necessary to get the ball to arc to where you can flip at it. &nbsp;Most flips should be aimed just outside the bumpers towards the side saucers. &nbsp;These are worth 100, 200 if lit. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s where the points are on this game. &nbsp;Flipping into the center of the bumpers is sometimes possible or necessary, since there&rsquo;s no way to cradle the ball on this game. &nbsp; If so, try to nudge the bumper rebounds either up top or towards those side saucers.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;the two pairs of mid-machine side lanes. &nbsp;The outer lanes&rsquo; exits should safely head towards a flipper for an immediate shot. &nbsp;The inner lanes often feed the outlanes behind the flippers, so there&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;ll need to nudge the game when the ball goes through either of these to avoid draining.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Nugent [SS &ndash;

shoot just outside the bumpers, i.e. at the right 3-bank and towards the collect saucer, and through the spinner on the right. &nbsp;A shot at the collect saucer will often rebound off the rubber below it into the standup target that lights the return lanes. &nbsp;The collect bonus saucer at the upper left is always active; bonus resets when collected but your multiplier remains for the rest of the ball in play. &nbsp;Once you have a good multiplier, try to collect bonus as often as you can. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t shoot it directly; having the ball bounce into it off the left bumper is your best bet. &nbsp;Flip the ball towards the saucer through the gap below it and nudge a lot. &nbsp;You can also get it in the saucer via a bank shot off the top right 3-bank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You can get the ball back in the plunger lane by holding the upper right flipper up and shooting the ball under it from the left flipper. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not worth the bother. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t shoot with that flipper, either; shots from it tend to hit the left drop targets which do little for your score, and the rebounds from those can drain. &nbsp;Just pretend that flipper&rsquo;s not even there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Check to see if the standard center post on the game is present and has rubber on it before you begin play. &nbsp;Without it, or with no rubber, center drains become more common.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Odds &amp;

a completed set of five is worth 15K while having four of each is worth only 8K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center saucer raises center post; the saucer is worth 500 until you finish the Odd numbers, then it&rsquo;s worth 5000. &nbsp;Top left saucer is likewise worth 500 until you finish the Even numbers, then it&rsquo;s 5000 (plus an extra ball if active). &nbsp;Each saucer spots the lit number &ndash; odd for the center, even for the top, although the number lit may be one you already have. &nbsp;The active number for the top left saucer is shown along the roulette arc below it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When you have the center post up, let the ball settle between it and either flipper, then use micro flips to set up shots. &nbsp;Balls hitting either of the two small white rollover buttons above the tops of the bottom slingshots each put the post back down. &nbsp;The kickout from the center saucer should go to the left flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are two gates on the right side of the machine. &nbsp;They are opened by the mushroom bumpers at the middle of the left side; the top bumper opens the top gate, the bottom mushroom opens the lower gate. &nbsp;Balls through the rights chute behind the gates score 4K if entering through the top gate and 2K if entering through the lower gate. &nbsp;Unlike the center post, the gates stay open for the remainder of the ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Most shots up the left orbit will not enter the upper saucer but continue up to the number rollovers at the top of the machine. &nbsp;Balls go in the left saucer most often from bounces off the left bumper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy: &nbsp;if you get the top gate open, go for that;

is really about lighting and scoring bumpers, especially the center one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill shot: &nbsp;make either the &ldquo;A&rdquo; or &ldquo;B&rdquo; lane at the top. &nbsp;The A lights the yellow upper left and lower right bumpers; B lights the red upper right and lower left bumpers. &nbsp;Getting both A and B on the same ball opens the ball save gate at the right outlane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hitting either of the standup targets just outside the bottom of the top A and B lanes scores 1000 and raises the center ball save post. &nbsp;Hitting the white rollover button not far above the center post lowers it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Advancing to score a goal is achieved by the A and B lanes, which give three advances each, the top and center bumpers, the rollover buttons arcing from right to left across the center of the machine and the side lanes (which also reset you to center ice after you score a goal &ndash; see below).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The main reason you want to score a goal is to light the center bumper for 1,000. &nbsp;That and those &ldquo;up post&rdquo; standup targets are the largest sources of points on the game. &nbsp;The tricky part happens after you score a goal: &nbsp;if the ball goes through either side lane that says &ldquo;start at center ice,&rdquo; play for the next goal begins and the bumper is turned off, back to just 100 points. &nbsp;(The yellow and red bumpers are not affected by this, they stay on if lit.) &nbsp;Your objective is thus to advance to score a goal, then get as many hits on that center bumper as you can before the ball randomly goes into either side lane to turn it off or drains. &nbsp;Everything resets each ball. &nbsp;Of course flipping the ball up towards the bumpers might also get you some accidental up post hits, which is good, too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While going UTAD, shoot for the gaps just outside the outer bumpers; this is safer than shooting into the bumper complex itself and should lead to a good amount of action. &nbsp;When flipping at the 1000 bumper, hit the edges of it so the ball skips off it and continues upward where it can bounce around more. &nbsp;Hitting the bottom of the bumper can drain.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Orbit [EM - Gottlieb, 1971]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;shoot the spinner on the right and the vari-target on the left to increase bonus, then try to go through the top right gate to collect it;

while the other squares toggle. &nbsp;If you get three X&rsquo;s or O&rsquo;s in a row, that lights the side saucers for 5000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One of the first things to do is shoot up top to get the A and B standup targets;

game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The primary feature here is the moving center rail of four colored disk targets, blue, red, yellow and green. &nbsp;Each disk lights a feature of the same color in the upper playfield when hit. &nbsp;When the rail is on the left side, the hit target lights a standup target above; when the rail is to the right, it lights a bumper. &nbsp;Once lit, any of these stay lit for the rest of the game unless you get an extra ball from them (see below). &nbsp;Hitting one of the standup targets on the sides of the machine near the center rail shifts the rail back and forth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy: &nbsp;hit as many of the rail disk targets as you can to light upper playfield features. &nbsp;Once you&rsquo;ve got most of the features lit, especially the standup targets, go UTAD. &nbsp;Nudge the ball when in the bumpers to try to direct it into any lit standups. &nbsp;If the opportunity arises to nudge to get the ball to go up a top lane [A-E], by all means do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The ball will rarely drain directly from the upper playfield; it&rsquo;s a tight angle to the sides, and a relatively small portion of the drop-downs from above go clean down the center without a chance to bounce them off a flipper or post. &nbsp;Most drains happen because you are unable to get control of the ball and it deflects around the lower playfield until going down the center or sides. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is another back-loaded game as far as scoring, i.e. most of your score will come on balls 4 and 5 since you&rsquo;ll have the most features lit then. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t let a bad ball 1 or 2 get to you; if you can get enough things lit later on, you can make a good come back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This add-a-ball version gives a ball for lighting all 4 bumpers, another for lighting all 4 standup targets, and one for getting all five A-E lanes, whether from the top lanes or the bottom outlanes. &nbsp;You can thus get an extra ball when you drain if you have four of the five letters and drain through the one you lack. &nbsp;Whenever you add a ball, the bumpers, targets or lanes you completed reset.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Panthera [SS - Gottlieb, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Up top until you have all four colors lit, then drop targets all day. &nbsp;Once the saucer on the left is lit to collect bonus, do so with a multiplier of 3X or more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Panthera is a bit better score balanced than some of its peers. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s also got a dozen drop targets for fans of these which are worth enough to play for.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is advanced by lit drop targets, the top right star rollovers, the right side bullseye target and lit 1-2-3 lanes. &nbsp;Base bonus goes up to 29K. &nbsp;Advancing your bonus multiplier is a two-step process. &nbsp;First, you need to score top lanes to light the drop targets of matching colors &ndash; white, green, yellow and blue. &nbsp;You then need to knock down all three lit targets of the same color to advance you one multiplier, up to 5X. &nbsp;At the end of a ball, any drop targets you knocked down that were lit stay down, ones you hit that were unlit pop back up. &nbsp;Base bonus resets but colored lanes and multiplier are held.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You want to hit drop targets when lit not just to work on your bonus X but because they&rsquo;re worth 5K lit, just 500 unlit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The top lanes also light the corresponding color return lanes and outlanes for 5K rather than 500. &nbsp;The top lanes are only worth 5K the first time you score them; likewise, the 1-2-3 lanes are worth 10K only the first time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The saucer below the left #2 lane scores 10K and 3 advances, but the ball doesn&rsquo;t always settle into it when exiting that #2 lane. &nbsp;Once you have at least 20K in base bonus, this saucer lights to collect bonus. &nbsp;When collected, base bonus resets but multiplier is preserved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Basic strategy is to go up top via the left spinner and right rollover star lane to get all the colors lit. &nbsp;Once you&rsquo;ve done that to make your targets worth 5K and set up getting your multipliers, shoot the drop targets. &nbsp;Focus on completing a color set at a time rather than one or two of each. &nbsp;Since your bonus multiplier is held, it&rsquo;s important to get it up as high as possible on ball one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As soon as you have your bonus at 20K with a multiplier of 3X or better, try to get the ball in the left collect bonus saucer. &nbsp;There are at least three ways to do this: &nbsp;shoot at it directly, which may risk a left side drain; nudge the ball into the top of the left #2 chute, although the ball will sometimes skip through; and have the right slingshot kick the ball into it, perhaps with a nudge assist on your part.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Yes, that sound you recognize is the same as on Counterforce - - thrum, thrum, thrum, thrum, and the wiggly-screech at the end.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Paragon [SS - Bally, 1979]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD, via the left side inline drop targets from the right flipper and either off of the right side target 3-bank or through the gate above them from the left flipper. &nbsp;Option to just use the left flipper to transfer to the right and do left drops only if you&rsquo;re good at tap passing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Paragon is one of the most popular solid state game ever made. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s somewhat bonus-heavy, but there are a lot of points to be had other ways, too. &nbsp; Bonus maxes at 5X and 49K for 245,000; if you get the bonus all the way up to 49, listen for the special high-pitched tone as the game finishes scoring your bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">EBs and Specials can be important. &nbsp;If set for points, EBs are 25K, specials 50K. &nbsp;EBs come only from the saucer behind the left side inlines; the first shot to it gets your 5X multiplier, the second gives you EB. &nbsp;There are several ways to score a special: &nbsp;finish the PARAGON letters [worth 25K plus a special]; finish the upper right side drop target bank 4 times on one ball; finish those same drops 5 times during the course of the whole game and then score a waterfall shot behind them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key Feeds: &nbsp;the rebounds from the left inline drops and the exit from the right side waterfall lane. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d also pay attention to the kickouts from both top saucers, with the intent of finding a way to nudge a bit to keep the ball up there and maybe hit that center standup target for a few bonus advances, or have the ball pop back up into either saucer again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;plunge for the left saucer [&ldquo;Golden Cliffs&rdquo;]. &nbsp;Value starts at 2K, goes up 2K per shot until reaching 20K, stays there. &nbsp;Value holds across balls for entire game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Drop catches, bounce passes, etc. all can be used to try to get the ball under control. &nbsp;The double right flipper means the ball can only be cradled on the right side on the upper flipper. &nbsp;If the ball is on or coming to the right flipper, you have two options: &nbsp;shoot the in-line drop targets or the spinner just right of them. &nbsp;The best strategy depends several things: &nbsp;how juicy is the spinner? &nbsp;How consistently does the ball continue through the spinner and onward safely into the right side waterfall lane afterwards? &nbsp;How likely are shots to the inline targets to drain? &nbsp;An what is your current bonus situation, including how close you are to reaching the 20K &ldquo;super bonus&rdquo; [or 30K or 40K]? &nbsp;For juicy spinners and safe follow-throughs, shoot the spinner until the bonus reaches 20,000, at which point that value is held for the rest of the game. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re close to 20K, shoot the spinner even if it&rsquo;s not juiced just to get to 20. &nbsp;Otherwise, shoot the drop targets to increase your bonus X and, eventually, score an extra ball or alternative points in lieu of one. &nbsp;Then get the base bonus to 20K or more later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;first, from the waterfall on the right. &nbsp;Does it land on a flipper? &nbsp;Which one? &nbsp;Does it graze the slingshot above the right flippers? &nbsp;Wherever it goes, can you get it cradled somehow, or must you shoot on the fly? &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve seen many variations: &nbsp;on-the-fly-only with the right flipper, dead bounce from left flipper to right, tip from right flipper to left, and ones where you must wing it each time depending upon how it hits the slingshot. &nbsp;Second and third key feeds are those from each of the two top saucers, which kick the ball in the vicinity of the top bumpers: &nbsp;can you nudge [or not] to get the ball to go back into either saucer a second time? &nbsp;Can you at least get the rebound off of the bumper to hit the top center &ldquo;advance bonus&rdquo; pad?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The &ldquo;Beast Lair&rdquo; [lower left]: &nbsp;you&rsquo;ll lose a fair amount of balls here; many can be saved but learning the nudging here is among the most advanced there is on any game. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s hard to describe how to do it, it just takes a lot of practice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Don&rsquo;t be shy about using the upper left miniflipper! &nbsp;While you can drain out the right side if you miss-time a flip with it, it&rsquo;s very useful for keeping the ball up top and away from the Beast Lair. &nbsp;Aim your shots with it between the left and center bumpers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sometimes after you clear the four inline drops, your shot towards the 5X bonus / Extra Ball saucer behind them will be rejected. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t let that get to you; just try again. &nbsp;If it happens a lot, try adjusting the speed of your shots a bit, e.g. slower.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One final caution: &nbsp;another way I see an unusually high percentage of balls drain is by the ball bouncing from the top right bumper to the mini-rubber just right of the Paragon saucer, then ricocheting down the center. &nbsp;Watch out for this.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Pat Hand [EM - Williams, 1975]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Up Top by going over the rollovers on the upper left side until your bonus is maxed at 10K. &nbsp;Collect the center A-K-Q-J-10 rollovers for 2X and 3X bonus, then UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This game is somewhat deceptive. &nbsp;Many players focus on the side joker targets or the lit 3000 target among the five in the top center bank. &nbsp;Nope. &nbsp;The big, safe[r] points here come from the rollovers at the very top of the machine. &nbsp;Soft plunge or Skill Shot to get the ball to roll over as many top rollovers as possible before then rolling smoothly over the rollovers above the upper left flipper. &nbsp;When the ball gets to that flipper, shoot it back up top to repeat the roll-down. &nbsp;Rollovers add to your bonus. &nbsp;Once the base bonus is maxed at 10,000, then you can deal with the center cards A-K-Q-J-10. &nbsp;Finishing them once lights the rollovers for 1,000; two completions lights double bonus. &nbsp;Once the rollovers are lit, forget everything else and throw the ball up top whenever you can, shooting along the upper left rollovers from the right flipper and straight up above the top joker from the left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;both sides of the top arc. &nbsp;When the ball dribbles off to the left, does it roll over most of the star rollovers on the left? &nbsp;If yes, get this as much as you can. &nbsp;If not, especially if it misses them all, switch tactics. &nbsp;When the ball dribbles off to the right, how high is the drain risk? &nbsp;Speed matters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for the two bumpers, simply hold the left flipper up at all times when the ball is in them to avoid center bumper-slam drains.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Pharaoh [SS &ndash; Williams, 1981]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A two-level game with a lot going on. &nbsp;There are three ways to get the ball from the lower playfield to the upper: &nbsp;two obvious ramps and an &ldquo;underchute&rdquo; assist kicker left of the center ramp. &nbsp;Shots here go into an upkicker hidden beneath the playfield and are ejected towards the upper left flipper. &nbsp;This is the easiest way up top, since a shot here doesn&rsquo;t need to have the strength to climb a vertical ramp. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s also the most valuable as you&rsquo;ll see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On the upper playfield are two drop target 3-banks which you use to light your locks. &nbsp;To light both locks, hit one of the targets in either upper 3-bank, then hit the same-colored target on the other upper 3-bank before hitting any other upper target. &nbsp;This also scores 5K and spots you a PHARAOH letter. &nbsp;If you hit a different target, the sequence resets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To start multiball, simply lock a ball. &nbsp;Plunge the other ball into play; after a few seconds, the locked ball will be ejected and start multiball. &nbsp;You can also start multiball instantly by locking the second ball. &nbsp;The game may be set to require locking both balls to start multiball; check first if you can. &nbsp;There are two locks: &nbsp;one up top left of the captive ball, the other down below between the right ramp and the center drop targets. &nbsp;Playfield scoring is doubled so long as you have two balls in play. &nbsp;Only point values are doubled, not bonus advances or magna units.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The captive ball advances P-H-A-R-A-O-H. &nbsp;If you shoot the ball up top via the underchute &ldquo;hidden tomb&rdquo; on the left, when the ball is ejected to the upper playfield, it starts a hurry-up score on the captive ball, and you&rsquo;ll have one good chance to hit it as the ball rolls down to the upper left flipper. &nbsp;The hurry-up value is higher the more letters in Pharaoh you have. &nbsp;Making the Slaves Tomb shot between the upper drop target banks also starts the captive ball hurry-up; the kickout from it should come to the tip of the upper left flipper to give you a shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Base bonus is advanced by both upper and lower drop targets: &nbsp;1K per target, an extra 3K each time you finish a 3-bank before its timer runs out. &nbsp;Bonus goes up to 49K. &nbsp;The standup bulls-eye targets, one at the right on the upper playfield, one at the left on the lower playfield, increase your bonus multiplier up to 5X. &nbsp;The upper target is always active, but the lower one only advances when lit. &nbsp;Base bonus resets, but any multiplier is held, so it&rsquo;s valuable to increase your bonus X on ball one to have it apply to all three balls. &nbsp;Bonus can be collected at the underchute shot when the green light in it is on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The game has magna saves above both inlanes; use them to deflect (they do not grab!) balls headed for the outlanes. &nbsp;Magna saves are triggered by buttons above the flipper buttons. &nbsp;You can earn up to 7 magna saves for each side by hitting drop targets in the lower playfield: &nbsp;right targets for the right magna save, center targets for the left magna save. &nbsp;The lower drop targets reset if not shot fast enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Game strategy is to advance your bonus multiplier to 5X a.s.a.p., then try to set up multiball. &nbsp;Whenever the ball is in the lower playfield, shoot the left underchute to get it up top and set up a hurry-up shot. &nbsp;During multiball, it&rsquo;s UTAD and just smack away at the drop targets and any captive ball opportunities you get.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The upper right flipper is normally a mini-flipper, but I&rsquo;ve seen that replaced with a standard size flipper on some games.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A few other tips: &nbsp;one good way to set up your lock is to cradle the ball with the upper left flipper and backhand the tomb shot, trying to graze the topmost target on the left drop bank on the way in. &nbsp;If successful, this will both start the sequence and set up your shot: &nbsp;the right target on the other bank will light and flash, and the ball will be kicked out of the tomb to the left flipper, often well-aligned for a shot at the flashing target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Have fun finding all the anachronisms and gag items in the game&rsquo;s artwork!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Phoenix [SS - Williams, 1978]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Up Top to advance bonus base and Phoenix letters. &nbsp;Next, get the drop target banks [four sets] to increase your bonus multiplier to 5X. &nbsp;Last, shoot for the bullseye target. &nbsp;For a quick 10K, shoot the A or B drop targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;on ball one, plunge for the 1; it&rsquo;s the one lane you can only get at the top. &nbsp;After that, go for whatever you need.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is a game that pretty much requires you to take risky shots to get a good score. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a typical bonus set-up for games of the era: &nbsp;29K max base, 5X max multiplier for 145,000 total possible. &nbsp;Base bonus is built up with lanes and targets. &nbsp;Bonus multiplier is advanced by completing either 4-bank of drop targets, hence the risk factor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The two center drop targets, &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B,&rdquo; are the most valuable, each scoring 10,000 and a bonus advance. &nbsp;Once hit, though, they stay down until you trip one of the designated lanes to relight them. &nbsp;Good points, but you need to go up top to re-enable them unless you get a return lane feed. &nbsp;[Top lane #2 and the left return lane relight &ldquo;A&rdquo;, top #4 and the right return lane relight &ldquo;B&rdquo;.&rdquo;]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shots to A and B can rebound to the sides, where the ball might also take out a multiplier bank target. &nbsp;If that works on your machine, use it. &nbsp;If you can clear a good portion of the side drops this way, consider a strategy of A; B; up top until both are relit; repeat, hoping to also complete some target banks for bonus X in the process.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Phoenix bullseye target is worth 3K plus a bonus advance until you have completed the 1 through 5 lanes. &nbsp;Besides the top five lanes, you can get the 2 and 4 from the return lanes and the 3 and 5 from the top standup targets. &nbsp;After that, it&rsquo;s worth the value shown by how many letters you have in P-H-O-E-N-I-X; each 1-5 completion adds a letter. &nbsp;This shot can be drainy, though, so try to find out in practice or by watching others if it&rsquo;s worth shooting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Observe that the return from bullseye shots will differ depending on whether or not you&rsquo;ve cleared the uppermost left drop target; if it&rsquo;s still standing, it may deflect the ball rebounding off of the bullseye. &nbsp;If either situation yields consistently safer returns than the other, try to get that top target first, or last, as appropriate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The spinner is lit when your base bonus is between 10K and 20K; odd bit of programming there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Phoenix can be very drainy and have super-short games, so keep that in mind if you have a choice of games with Phoenix in the bank.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Pin Up [EM &ndash; Gottlieb, 1975]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Shoot lit drop targets all day. &nbsp;If you have a ball cradled and no lit drop targets in the line of fire, go up top [in front of the face of the upper slingshots].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the add-a-ball version of King Pin with different scoring.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unlike King Pin (the replay version), Pin Up suffers from point flatness. &nbsp;All ten drop targets are always worth the same 1000 points, removing the skill premium for hitting the lit target as on King Pin. &nbsp;Since the lit saucer up top and the lit return and lit outlane at the bottom are worth 5K, getting drop targets at all becomes less important unless extra balls are on. &nbsp;If they are, when you complete the 10 drop targets, for the remainder of that ball in play hitting the lit pin will add a ball, as will the lit standup target undeath the upper flippers. &nbsp;Since you can move the lit drop target by hitting the center star rollover, you can get multiple extra balls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If extra balls are off, your best strategy is just UTAD to the very top, trying to score the lit top saucer for 5000. &nbsp;Shoot targets only when you can&rsquo;t shoot up top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Skill Shot is to drop the ball into the lit saucer at the top for 5000; that&rsquo;s big points on this machine. &nbsp;The unlit one is worth just 500 and missing both is common if you&rsquo;re careless. &nbsp;Line up your Skill Shot mark and prepare to nudge a bit to make sure you get it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The side outlane angles here are a bit different from other machines; balls going in fast that don&rsquo;t touch the top curve have a decent chance to bounce off the side wall into the return lanes. &nbsp;When the ball goes in slowly or hits that curve, you&rsquo;re likely toast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds - - balls through the top side lanes;

lites top center hole is best, since if you then score that hole your bonus is tripled. &nbsp;Double bonus is next best, then the 50,000. &nbsp;Extra ball beats them all if allowed, but in tournaments will likely be turned off. &nbsp;Lites spinner is useful, too, but the spinners on these aren&rsquo;t usually too juicy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Yes, there are 5 drop targets on the game, but ignore them completely. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll get the upper four eventually from balls coming down around the hole. &nbsp;Completing them is only worth 10K, not worth the risk of shooting the bottom left one.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Pinball Pool [SS &ndash;

ask ahead or watch before you play.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You must finish all 15 pool balls &ndash; 14 drop targets plus the center captive ball &ndash; to light the saucers for score bonus. &nbsp;But make four saucer shots first to get your bonus multiplier maxed out at 5X; it goes up one level per shot. &nbsp;Bonus is 1K per pool ball, thus 15K for a complete rack, times your multiplier for up to 75K. &nbsp;Bonus resets to zero when collected but the multiplier is preserved for the rest of the ball in play.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Note on bonus X: &nbsp;the saucer awards your bonus X increase before it awards your collect bonus if lit, so you can have the saucer at 4X and still get max bonus of 75K if you&rsquo;ve completed the rack when you shoot it. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s all plus the 5000 base value of the saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Side drains also score 5K and advance your bonus X (if not already at 5X) so that can be worth an extra 20K vs. a center drain with a complete rack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A-B-C just lights extra ball, usually turned off, so ignore these.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;the kickouts from the two saucers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Pink Panther [SS &ndash;

saucer hidden under the left side of the machine; entry is both above and below the targets. &nbsp;The center target 3-bank lights the &ldquo;hidden staircase&rdquo; saucer under the right side; entry is above the visible extra ball saucer. &nbsp;When both balls are locked and you plunge the third ball, multiball begins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is usually not significant unless you play multiball. &nbsp;Base bonus is earned from standup targets when the diamond below them is lit (by a top lane) and by the standup targets and left drop targets during multiball; it goes up to 29K. &nbsp;Bonus multiplier is raised when any individual spot target is hit three times and goes up to 5X for 145K total. &nbsp;Bonus can be collected during a ball by hitting a spot target a fourth time. &nbsp;In action, it&rsquo;s rare to get to maximum bonus or maximum multiplier without playing multiball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Pink Panther can play slow, in part due to not having active slingshots next to the flippers. &nbsp;The ball sometimes seems to float around the playfield unless the flippers and bumpers are strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Locks can&rsquo;t be stolen but can be removed. &nbsp;If you lock a ball, other players must lock the opposite ball, which then releases yours. &nbsp;If they can then lock that ball, they play multiball. &nbsp;They still have to earn two locks on their own, but if they play multiball, your lock is lost.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Pioneer [EM - Gottlieb, 1976]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Up Top until you have all five letters, then complete the drop targets. &nbsp;With both done, shoot the center saucer for double bonus when lit [it cycles]. &nbsp;Then UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the 2-player version of Spirit of 76.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Focus on the drop targets, although if extra balls are on, the lanes can become important, too. &nbsp;More than half of your points in a game can come from bonus, especially if you can double it. &nbsp;Base bonus is 15K, advanced by hitting a drop target or triggering a lit star rollover. &nbsp;Each lettered lane lights a star rollover [the one nearest each lane]. &nbsp;Scoring all five letters lights center saucer for Extra Ball on a digit cycle; all 8 drop targets lights the saucer for double bonus on the cycle; completing both the targets and the lanes lights it for special on cycle. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a way to get 4x bonus: &nbsp;light double bonus in the saucer, score it, relight double bonus in the saucer, shoot it. &nbsp;Since you already have double bonus lit, it instead awards you 4X bonus. &nbsp;This is the most valuable shot in the game. &nbsp;End of ball bonus is doubled if you&rsquo;ve made the doubler shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;make the C. &nbsp;Even if EBs are off, the C shot will light the center star rollover for bonus advances, and you should get at least one right away when the ball exits the C lane over it. &nbsp;As for the other letters, if you get them, fine, but don&rsquo;t bother shooting at them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The rebounds from hitting the drop targets are risky, but you need to shoot them, so plan on quick reflex nudging to save drain-bound bounces.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Playball [EM - Gottlieb, 1971]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD towards the two top corner Triples horseshoes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While the game is oriented towards scoring runs more than points, I have seen it in competition, so here it is. &nbsp;If you want points, go up top for the 300-point triples. &nbsp;Balls falling through those should come down to the same flipper for another shot or better, a dead bounce to the other flipper for a controlled mirror shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Any time you can get hits on the center bumper when lit or deflect the ball into the side double chutes, do so. &nbsp;The bumpers stay lit once on and may even start the game lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You should probably ignore the vari-targets; they&rsquo;re tighter shots than some and a missed shot can easily drain. &nbsp;If you can safely forehand or backhand them and push the ball back far enough to score a 500-point home run, give it a go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Consistently draining out the sides for 500 (and a home run) can be big in a low-scoring match.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The game has an autoplunger between the flippers, so there&rsquo;s no skill shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;balls exiting the doubles side lanes;

&nbsp;Base bonus goes up to 39,000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus multipliers are earned via getting all five keys, i.e. the four top lanes and the center standup target. &nbsp;First time gives 2X, second time 3X, third time 5X, and after that a special, worth 50K if set to points. &nbsp;Bonus multipliers are held. &nbsp;Maximum total bonus is 195,000 per ball, and up to 100K is held.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The other huge reason to finish the keys at least once each ball is that doing so lights the &ldquo;Grotto&rdquo; chute under that top left gate for 25,000. &nbsp;Once you have that 25,000 lit, go to town on it. &nbsp;Besides getting points for it, it also ejects the ball to the top, giving you a chance to work on another set of key lanes, and you&rsquo;ll get a bonus advance for each lane, too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for the other stuff, finishing the drop target bank lights the outlanes for 25K, so if you get them, try to &ldquo;drain wisely&rdquo; out the sides. &nbsp;They also light the special, which may be set to award 50,000 points, and finishing additional sets of drop targets awards the same 50K special value.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing the playmate standup targets lights the extra ball star rollover in the little arc just above the top playmate. &nbsp;Additional playmate sets light the rollover for special, 50K if set for points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While you can get 50K from enough sets of either the drop target or standup target bank, they both have drain risk and require several shots to complete. &nbsp;I find that sticking with the UTAD-grotto-keys route is the safer play. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d only deliberately go for a target if I was down to one left [or two adjacent targets] in either bank, or just needed one to get to the 20K super bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Super bonus is harder to reach than on other Bally games of this era;

SS - Bally, 1978]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;drop targets all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;have the ball go over the top star rollover to raise the center post, then drop into the top saucer. &nbsp;The saucer starts out worth 3K and goes up 3K per shot until it maxes out at 15K; enough of those can really add up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Power Play is mostly about bonus and a bit about the top saucer. &nbsp;For the bonus route, shoot the drop targets; completing either bank [not both!] advances your bonus multiplier to 2X, 3X, then 5X. &nbsp;After that, a bank scores an extra ball or special, which is usually set to be worth good points [25K and 50K]. &nbsp;Base bonus goes up to 29K, so your maximum overall is 145K. &nbsp;Drops, orbits and lanes all advance bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once your bonus multiplier is at 5X, you can either continue shooting drops or, if balls to the top drop into the saucer a high percentage of the time, you can switch to UTAD via the orbits for saucers. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Use caution with the upper flippers: &nbsp;while they&rsquo;re great at nailing the drop targets, the ball is also more prone to drain out the side when shooting crisscross. &nbsp;If the upper flippers are weak or if shots with them are inconsistent, either let the ball roll by them or use them to deflect the ball to a soft landing on a lower flipper, especially if the center post is up. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll also find that shooting the drops with the bottom flippers often gives you a chance at the top saucer, too, since the ball usually rebounds off them up towards the top of the machine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Whenever you shoot orbits or drop targets, try to get the ball&rsquo;s continuation beyond them to hit the top rollover if the post isn&rsquo;t already up, and to drop again into the saucer; nudge as necessary. &nbsp;Hitting the center stand-up target raises the center post, too. &nbsp;The return lanes lower the center post.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball control: &nbsp;unlike many games, the &ldquo;down post&rdquo; triggers on Power Play are not in the playfield above the flippers; instead, they&rsquo;re the two return lanes. &nbsp;This means that once the post is up, balls falling down the middle of the playfield can be safely allowed to settle onto one of the center post-flipper contact points. &nbsp;You can then use micro-flips to get the ball where you want it for precision shots at the drop targets or orbits. &nbsp;Balls coming down the return lanes require you to either flip away or hold the flipper up to cradle it or transfer it across to the opposite side.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Pro Football [EM - Gottlieb, 1973]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD, through the spinner if possible. &nbsp;If the flippers are very strong and can push the vari-targets all the way back, you can do vari-targets instead if the rebound from them is safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot? &nbsp;No, this game autoplunges the ball out the center drain when you flip the right flipper. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s actually one of the most dangerous moments on the game. &nbsp;If the autoplunge is too weak, the ball might hit just one or two switches, then fall back down to a center drain. &nbsp;Watch out!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Your best points on this game are the center spinner and the vari-targets. &nbsp;You can hit the spinner with any of the four flippers, but you&rsquo;ll do best to use the lower ones since the shot angle is better for going through. &nbsp;The vari-targets score more the further back you push them; which flipper, upper or lower, does that better is a bit more variable from machine to machine. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s also affected by how steep or shallow the game is. &nbsp;This is a case where you may need to have the ball rolling down the flipper face to add that extra bit of energy to the shot to push the vari-target all the way back. &nbsp;Vari-target values range from 1000 plus 10 yards to 5000 plus 50 yards for a fully-back hit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Touchdowns are scored every 100 yards and award 6000 points. &nbsp;The lanes, spinner and vari-targets all spot you yards towards that. &nbsp;Side drains score a touchdown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The upper flippers of each pair are better for getting the ball up top into the bumper zone; here, the ball can get popped up one of the top lanes for yardage towards a touchdown and points. &nbsp;Obviously you prefer the 50 yards / 500 point lanes [center-most of the three lanes on each side at the top and also the two far outside lanes, one on each side] to the lesser ones when given a chance to nudge between them as the ball is popping around. &nbsp;[Ignore the &ldquo;when lit&rdquo; on the top lanes; they always score those values.]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The paired flippers take some getting used to since they&rsquo;re at different angles with the upper ones at a steeper angle and the lower ones shallower.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Pro Pool [EM - Gottlieb, 1973]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Get all 15 pool balls, then UTAD, trying to get the 8-ball lane for 5,000 or as many other top lanes and bumper hits as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the single-player add-a-ball version of Hot Shot / Big Shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One of several pool-themed games where your goal is to collect all 15 pool balls. &nbsp;On this game, 14 of these are in two rows of seven standup targets on each side. &nbsp;The last is the eight ball, earned from either the top center lane [your Skill Shot] or the center saucer [risky shot]. &nbsp;The eight ball shot also opens the ball return gate on the lower right side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is 1000 per pool ball, 15k max. &nbsp;Unlike Hot Shot and Big Shot, Pro Pool does not increase the bonus values on your last two balls. &nbsp;This makes the game more balanced; your last ball is not worth so much more than your first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One drawback of this game is that once you&rsquo;ve collected all of the pool balls, there&rsquo;s not much to do - - the targets don&rsquo;t reset in the replay version like they do in the add-a-ball one, and there&rsquo;s no collect bonus feature. &nbsp;About all that&rsquo;s left is are the lanes for 500 or 1000 each and the bumper for 1000 at that stage.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Prospector [EM - Sonic, 1977]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Shoot the left orbit to get the gold bonus up to 100K and get the #5 and #6 standups for double bonus, then spinners all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right until Gold bonus maxed, then balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Built by Sonic [Spain], and playing a lot like a Williams, Prospector is a frequent favorite for Classics tournaments. &nbsp;It has two major strategies: &nbsp;Gold Bonus [primary] and Lit Spinners [secondary]. &nbsp;The gold bonus maxes at 2 times 100K. &nbsp;Build it by shooting the left orbit [or nudging the ball to fall down through that lane from above]. &nbsp;You can also advance it by hitting any lit gold star rollover - - at the top of the machine, when lit, either on the Skill Shot or from bumper action kicking it up from below, or two on each side of the playfield. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t bother shooting the playfield star rollovers, though, especially the left side ones. &nbsp;The ball rebounds too randomly off these. &nbsp;Shooting the two on the right is okay, but you&rsquo;re generally better off shooting for the 5-6 if you don&rsquo;t have them yet, or the spinner [see below].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The 2X bonus is achieved by hitting the number 5 and 6 standup targets on the middle right side of the machine. &nbsp;Targets 1-4 are for lighting EB, which will almost always be turned off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Silver bonus is built up mostly via the two center spinners: &nbsp;spin them enough and the bonus goes up to 10K, collectible in the center saucer or far upper right saucer. &nbsp;But try NOT to collect it! &nbsp;Once the silver bonus is maxed, one of the spinners will always be lit for 1000 per spin. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s more valuable than collecting it and relighting it. &nbsp;Either spinner can be hit from either flipper. &nbsp;Light it and rip it!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">General order of business is any time the ball is in control on the right flipper and your base gold bonus is less than 100K, shoot the left orbit gold lane. &nbsp;From the left flipper, shoot for the 5-6 targets. &nbsp;Once you&rsquo;ve completed either task, change your shot with that flipper to the silver spinners to light them and them spin them lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Most left gold shots will continue across and into the scoop on the upper right side. &nbsp;This adds 5K and a silver bonus advance, making this dual shot worth at least 15K plus whatever improvement that gets you on silver. &nbsp;The scoop then kicks out into the bumpers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball control: &nbsp;you can&rsquo;t shatz up the return lanes due to the sharp corner in the wires, but you can use the move to transfer the ball to the other flipper. &nbsp;Some players choose to shatz left to right to max out the gold bonus at 100K before going for the 5-6 targets as a safety play. &nbsp;Be careful shooting the 6, the rebound may hit the post to its left; shots at the 5 usually continue up top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Side drains are much preferable to center: &nbsp;10K plus a gold advance, worth another 10K if you&rsquo;re not maxed, 20K if doubled. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re playing last, or after your main opponent, keep that in mind if that would be enough to win.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feed: &nbsp;left gold lane. &nbsp;When the ball comes down it, does it go safely to a flipper at all speeds, only some speeds, or never? &nbsp;Learn when to nudge this, if needed.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Pyramid [EM &ndash;

these rollovers are worth 5000 per hit, the best value on the game. &nbsp;You also will get points when the ball then drops through a top lane, including a chance to get another color towards your end of ball bonus. &nbsp;The ball will then often also land in one of the saucers as it drops down the playfield, scoring more points and further helping your bonus cause. &nbsp;Also observe that shots to the top that miss may rattle around in the bumpers and or drop into a side saucer. &nbsp;If you make the shot, great, if you miss but still go through to the top half of the playfield, not too bad either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is two step: &nbsp;you only score bonus when you&rsquo;ve collected both a top lane and a drop target of matching color. &nbsp;Their bonus value differs by color, too, with red worth 5000, white 4000, blue 3000, yellow 2000 and green 1000. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s possible to double your bonus by collecting both side saucers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While shooting at the five drop targets in the center of the playfield to enable that half of your bonus is tempting, it&rsquo;s not your best strategy. &nbsp;Drop target shots risk draining if not precise, and even then, hitting a target at the wrong angle can still lead to draining.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds are the kickouts from the side saucers. &nbsp;Can you nudge for a repeat saucer collect off of the bumpers and top wedge slings? &nbsp;Can you at least get some bumper action off of the kickout?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Quarterback [EM - Bally, 1976]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD, with option for drop targets on the right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Quarterback, with its football theme, and its sister game Kick Off, with a soccer theme, are not common competition games since they&rsquo;re both geared more towards extra balls and replays. &nbsp;I have seen them, though, so they&rsquo;re here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In Quarterback, the goal is to move the ball down the field to score a touchdown. &nbsp;The top lanes, drop targets on the right and spinner on the left award progress. &nbsp;Touchdowns score 5K. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s not much to do here other than flip at the spinner, the drop targets or go up top on the right. &nbsp;Drop targets reset every ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus goes up to 15K, advanced 1K every 20 yards. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s normally automatically doubled on balls 3 and 5 and cannot be doubled during other balls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">The skill shot is to get one of the two lit lanes at the top;

games since it can be difficult to get the ball cradled on either an upper or lower flipper. &nbsp;Since few of your shots will be precise controlled ones from a cradle, you&rsquo;ll need to learn to aim on the fly.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Quick Draw [EM &ndash;

results or test it before your game, if permitted, to see where A and C plunges go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy: &nbsp;UTAD until ball 5. &nbsp;Try to bank the ball off one of the bumpers and into one of the saucers. &nbsp;Saucers score 1000 + 1000 per A/B/C letter collected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You may see players shoot drops before ball 5. &nbsp;I disagree: &nbsp;the rebounds from the drops are risky. &nbsp;The one situation where shooting drops is okay early in the game is if you find that the rebound from a particular drop target goes up top and lands in a saucer. &nbsp;This is most likely for the top two targets on each side. &nbsp;Drop targets advance bonus; completing all drops in both banks will reset just the two center [black] targets, which are then worth 5000 each.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On ball 5, the bonus is automatically doubled, so shooting drops is more valuable. &nbsp;Bonus maxes at 15K. &nbsp; &nbsp;(When set to 3 balls, completing A-B-C activates double bonus on balls 1 and 2 and scores triple bonus on ball 3. &nbsp;On 5 balls, completing A-B-C does not change the bonus multiplier; it&rsquo;s single bonus on balls 1-4, double bonus on ball 5.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When shooting drops, try to hit them one at a time! &nbsp;While getting two at once makes better progress towards completing them, there&rsquo;s no reward for that until all ten are down [see above]. &nbsp;Until then, hitting two drops at once, or worse two on one side and one or more on the other via a quick rebound, scores only 1 bonus advance! &nbsp;Yes, the drops advance bonus, but it&rsquo;s not one advance per target down, it&rsquo;s one advance per &ldquo;registered&rdquo; drop. &nbsp;Getting more than one too quickly doesn&rsquo;t score as multiple hits; Fast Draw registers target hits slowly enough that this is a common occurrence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Quick&rdquo; Draw often plays slow, so be careful when dead bouncing to make sure the ball is moving fast enough to make it across. &nbsp;But a fast-falling dead bounce will sometimes roll all the way up the side A or C lane, collecting it. &nbsp;You want that!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Quicksilver [SS - Stern, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Shoot the right side drop target 3-bank from the left flipper;

when the center is lit for yellow, the top right advance is lit, when the center is on green, the top left advance is lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Building and collecting bonus is the route. &nbsp;Bonus builds from the top left and right lanes when lit, the stand-up target below the left lane and the chute through the gate at the upper right. &nbsp;Shooting the three red drop targets once for R-A-N gives you double bonus and lights the spinner on the left for 1K. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t bother shooting them a second time unless extra balls are on; the rebounds off them are drainy. &nbsp;If extra balls are on, completing these twice to spell &ldquo;Rancho&rdquo; lights the middle left saucer for your Extra Ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Saucer values are green 5K unlit, 50K lit and yellow 3K unlit, 30K lit. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t bother shooting at the yellow one, only the green one via the spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The top right chute scores a bonus advance plus one more advance for each lit color. &nbsp;Since the chute also ejects the ball to the top to score a top lane for another potential advance or to light the other color saucer, that&rsquo;s the best play when the spinner is not lit.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Rawhide [EM &ndash;

you might see it under either name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill shot: &nbsp;get the ball in the top saucer. &nbsp;Ideally, you want it lit for double bonus when it goes in, so you may want the ball to hit the top button once or twice first to change the saucer value. &nbsp;As you&rsquo;ll see by the lights below the lower (center) saucer, they can also award lighting the spinners and bumpers, lighting the saucers for 5K or lighting one outlane for an extra ball lane if enabled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is built by the return lanes, outlanes and the three small rollover buttons, the one at the very top and two others a few inches above the flippers. &nbsp;Base bonus goes up to 19K. &nbsp;Getting double bonus involves a bit of luck since you need to have &ldquo;lites double bonus&rdquo; on when you make either saucer shot. &nbsp;The catch is, any shot to change the saucer value may rebound and change it again before you get the ball back on a flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The strategy here is up top via the spinner until you collect each of the different saucer values at the top hole. &nbsp;Keep that up until your bonus is maximized. &nbsp;Even then, stay with it since one good lit spinner shot plus random points up top is worth far more than the captive ball or any of the standup targets.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Ro Go [EM - Bally, 1974]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Center horseshoe shot all day. &nbsp;Nudge the ball through any of the three gates when open if you can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ro Go is another bonus-focused game, but more balanced than many others. &nbsp;Your Skill Shot is the top center lane, which scores 1000, opens both gates on the right side and advances bonus by 1000. &nbsp;The two top saucers each score 500, give two bonus advances rather than one, but only open one gate - - the right saucer opens the upper gate, the left saucer opens the lower [center of the playfield] gate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Only one of the four highest-scoring shots on this game can be shot directly - - the center horseshoe. &nbsp;This is good for 5000 and five bonus advances, plus the advance switches you go over on the way up and down. &nbsp;Going only partway up either side of it earns 1000 and one advance if you just barely trip the switch, 2000 and two advances if you go past the switch far enough to trip it a second time on the way down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The other three high-value shots each require an indirect approach. &nbsp;One is the collect bonus chute on the left side, where the ball needs to bounce sideways through the gap to go in. &nbsp;The other two are those gates when open - - you score 6K through the lower gate or 8K through the upper one and it returns the ball to the plunger lane. &nbsp;You want to nudge the ball through them whenever possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Basic strategy is shoot the center horseshoe when possible, go up top if you need to, and get the ball through any open gate. &nbsp;If the flippers are strong enough to backhand the horseshoe, that provides you with a wider angle to make the shot than going cross-field.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Rock [SS &ndash;

the slingshots change the lit spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For bonus, you get two advances for hitting the lit target among the center 5-bank (light cycles on a timer) and one advance for any of the four return lanes if lit. &nbsp;The return lanes go out when collected and can only be turned back on by hitting the &ldquo;reset letters&rdquo; bullseye standup target to the right of the 5-bank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is 10K per letter and goes up to 150K. &nbsp;If you complete all 15 letters during a ball in play, it awards your bonus immediately and resets the letters. &nbsp;Bonus multiplier is advanced by completing the top right three A-B-C lanes and goes up to 5X for 750K total. &nbsp;Letters and multiplier are saved from ball to ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you shoot the loop-around shot just right of the center of the playfield, you get a brief period of double playfield scoring. &nbsp;This is most useful if the right spinner is lit, since the return from the loop-around will usually go through the two left return lanes to feed the left flipper, giving you a shot at the right spinner for 20K a spin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Extra balls, normally off in competition, score 500K. &nbsp;Finishing your letters will light it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The upper 1-2-3-4 playfield is primarily for winning replays; it awards more points for each level completed, but not enough to compete with the spinner. &nbsp;When the ball is in there, shoot it anyway just because it&rsquo;s safe points. &nbsp;Get the numbers in order to advance to the next level; the one you need next will flash. &nbsp;Each set of four moves you on to the next level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feed: &nbsp;balls exiting the upper playfield; they might not fall smoothly to the left flipper, instead bouncing off the top of the divider below the exit of the spinner.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Rock &lsquo;N Roll [EM - Williams, 1970]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;raise center post, then UTAD with option for center saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill shot: &nbsp;drop the ball into the top saucer for a Spin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the add-a-ball version of Jive Time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Williams liked this 5-bumper arrangement back in the early 70&rsquo;s, using it several times. &nbsp;Four of the bumpers can be lit by hitting the two standup targets just above them on each side of the top saucer - - left for green, right for yellow. &nbsp;The outer two standup targets near the top advance bonus, as do the standup targets on either side of the center saucer. &nbsp;Base bonus goes up to 10,000 and can be doubled by the spin disk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are two saucers, one up top and one in the center, which award you a random spin value; the spinner is on the backglass, rather than under the playfield. &nbsp;It spins first; you don&rsquo;t get the currently-pointed-at award. &nbsp;There are six possible awards: &nbsp;2 each of 1,000 points, 3000 points, collect bonus and &ldquo;Open West Gate&rdquo;, plus one each of 10,000 and Double Bonus. &nbsp;The West Gate in essence is &ldquo;light extra ball&rdquo; since that&rsquo;s what a ball through it scores.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s a good chance a ball shot at the center saucer will sail through, but that&rsquo;s not all bad either since it gets the ball into the bumpers. &nbsp;As long as you&rsquo;re accurate enough to go in or through rather than hit one of the posts to the side of the saucers, it&rsquo;s your best controlled shot. &nbsp;The other way to score safely is to shoot the ball up the sides of the game, trying to get the ball to rattle around in the bumpers as long as possible. &nbsp;This sometimes produces an &ldquo;around the world&rdquo; shot which may hit more than one of the light bumpers and advance bonus standup targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are two ball saver posts on the game, a light-up center one and a smaller one in the right outlane. &nbsp;The center post is raised by hitting the standup target at the far left of the center saucer; the right outlane post is raised by a similar standup target on the right. &nbsp;Both posts are lowered when you hit either the down posts standup on the right or the down posts rollover button near the westgate on the left. &nbsp;When the center post is up, you can let the ball settle between it and either flipper to set up shots. &nbsp;The right outlane post, though, is not foolproof - - the ball can sneak around it and still drain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Assuming the bumpers are reasonably lively, I don&rsquo;t bother shooting for the center spin saucer, I just go up the sides of the game and try to get the ball to bounce off of the bumpers into the top saucer or roll down into the center saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Try to hit the left target to raise the center post a.s.a.p. &nbsp;That will make subsequent shots safer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Don&rsquo;t ever shoot at the standup targets on either side of the center saucer; you&rsquo;ll advance the bonus more safely with the upper targets.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bonus is not awarded at the end of a ball, only by collecting it via a spin. &nbsp;One downside to this game is that the spin values are random, so luck can play a part in the game outcome, e.g. if you get 1,000 and your opponent gets double bonus for 20,000.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Rock Star [EM - Gottlieb, 1978]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;standup targets all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the add-a-ball version of Blue Note. &nbsp;The scoring is different enough to merit its own listing. &nbsp;BUT I have seen Rock Star games that use the Blue Note scoring rather than what&rsquo;s here, so you&rsquo;ll need to check the one you&rsquo;re playing to be certain!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The standup note scale &ldquo;do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-do&rdquo; targets on the left wall of the game are where it&rsquo;s at. &nbsp;They score 5000 the first time hit, i.e. when lit, but then score 500 per hit after that, i.e. when unlit. &nbsp;This is exactly the reverse of the scoring on Blue Note! &nbsp;It changes your strategy a bit. &nbsp;Now, instead of trying to get all notes except one and milking the unlit targets at that point, you want to complete the standups as often as possible to re-light them for 5000. &nbsp;When you complete the standups, one will light for a &ldquo;WOW&rdquo;, i.e. an extra ball. &nbsp;Which one is lit moves as you hit the bumpers. &nbsp;Hit the lit standup to reset the targets to their initial 5000 point values.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are two spinners: &nbsp;the central [left-most] one can be worth 10, 100 or 1000 points per spin; the right-hand spinner changes the value of the central spinner. &nbsp;While at 1000 points per spin this is good value, I&rsquo;ve found that shooting the spinner is not the best strategy. &nbsp;Balls through the spinner go directly into the center of the three bumpers, and it&rsquo;s not uncommon for those to spit the ball back down through the spinner and into the center drain. &nbsp;Unless your spinner is super-juicy, the cost-benefit just isn&rsquo;t there. &nbsp;Most Rock Stars give maybe 5-7 spins per shot; compare that to the 5000 you get for hitting each lit standup target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The offset flippers and lack of a left outlane make ball control strategy on Blue Note, unlike most other games. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll want to hold the left flipper up at times as a kind of shield and a means to deflect the ball to the right flipper, which is the one you want to be taking your shots with. &nbsp;Ball transfers from left to right from a cradle are alley-pass-or-nothing: &nbsp;there&rsquo;s no post for a post pass, and these Gottlieb flippers don&rsquo;t react well for tap passing. &nbsp;Alley passing can be tricky, though, due to both the flipper offset and angle. &nbsp;If you weren&rsquo;t able to use the left flipper to deflect the ball to the right one and up end with the ball cradled on the left, backhanding the ball into the left side of the left-hand bumpers is actually a good plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If extra balls are on, you can accumulate up to 5 of them! &nbsp;The note-balloons on the left side of the backglass will light up &ldquo;WOW&rdquo; whenever you earn an add-a-ball; as indicated by the number of these lights, you can bank up to 5 of them. &nbsp;Extra balls, if on, are unlimited other than this maximum of 5 banked at any given time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key Feeds: &nbsp;kick out from the saucer [should go to the left flipper, but beware center drains] and balls coming down through either spinner.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Rocky [SS &ndash; Gottlieb, 1982]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;Complete the numbered targets 1-10 in order, then shoot the left orbit to the saucer all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Perhaps the most interesting flipper layout in pinball, Rocky makes you retrain your reflexes. &nbsp;Before getting to the rules, let&rsquo;s discuss the flippers. &nbsp;You have 1 upper flipper, in the center of the game but facing right, which operates as a normal left flipper. &nbsp;At the bottom, you have 4 flippers in two pairs. &nbsp;Each left-facing flipper is triggered by the right flipper button and vice versa. &nbsp;The easiest way to get used to them is just mentally eliminate the other half of the playfield from your mind and play each side as its own separate playfield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The vertical and near-vertical slingshot pairs above each flipper set are very active. &nbsp;The ball will rapidly punch back and forth between them, so be alert, you may need to flip in a hurry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You need to complete the 10 &ldquo;rounds&rdquo; in order; each is a single drop target, scattered around the playfield. &nbsp;The 1, 4, 7 and 10 targets are at the upper right. &nbsp;Targets 3, 6 and 9 are on the middle left. &nbsp;Targets 2, 5 and 8 are at the middle right. &nbsp;You therefore need to alternate sections of the playfield to make progress. &nbsp;The &ldquo;current round,&rdquo; i.e. the next target you need to hit, is displayed in the window below the lower left flipper. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t confuse this with your current bonus value, indicated by the numbered circles in the center of the playfield. &nbsp;Rounds are on timers; take too long and you lose the round (the timer runs on switch hits, not a clock).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Why win rounds? &nbsp;Besides scoring 10000, they&rsquo;re your bonus multiplier. &nbsp;Win 2-4 rounds for 2X, 5-7 rounds for 5X and 8-10 rounds for 10X bonus. &nbsp;Base bonus goes up to 19K, earned by drop target hits. &nbsp;Bonus and targets reset each ball, but rounds and multipliers do not. &nbsp;After you win or lose Round 10, though, you collect bonus as it stands at that moment and then both the base and the multipliers reset.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">General strategy for getting the numbers in order is to hit them when the next one you need is in front of the flipper you have the ball on and when that&rsquo;s not the case, go up top and wait for or try to nudge the ball to come near the flipper you need. &nbsp;If you hit a target out of sequence, it stays down until you complete the bank it&rsquo;s in. &nbsp;If you hit the 3 target on the lower left, for instance, before you&rsquo;re in round three, you must also drop the 6 and 9 targets to reset the bank in order to have the 3 target available to shoot at again. &nbsp;Since you&rsquo;ll often get lower targets by accident just making saves off the active lower slingshots or missing your shot, expect to have to do this more than once a game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball control is tricky. &nbsp;Most of the time, you can transfer balls between flippers on either half of the lower playfield by holding the flipper up when the ball goes down the lanes above the &ldquo;outer&rdquo; pair (left jab and right hook) and dead bouncing off either the outer or &ldquo;inner&rdquo; pair (&ldquo;right hook&rdquo; and &ldquo;left jab&rdquo;) when the ball is falling towards them. &nbsp;Getting the ball from one lower half to the other usually requires going up to the top of the machine and trying to guide it down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You get two &ldquo;instant round wins&rdquo; per game by hitting the green button on the left if the instant win light is on in the lower center of the playfield. &nbsp;You need to hit it if that light is on and the ball enters the bottom &ldquo;on the ropes&rdquo; upkicker; do so before it hits the switch just above the kicker, otherwise you lose that round. &nbsp;Balls tripping that upkicker collect your bonus; the base resets but you keep your multiplier. &nbsp;The ball can also bounce off to either side; draining out one of the center sides scores 15K and wins a round if that side is lit; which is lit alternates. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When the ball is about to go through a 5000-when-lit lane, always use the lane change to light it. &nbsp;Completing all four either wins the current round or lights an instant win, depending on game settings. &nbsp;It also lights the 50K target on the lower left and may light the outer flipper return lanes for 20K, the latter also setting-dependent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The last shot to note is the left orbit &ldquo;knock out punch&rdquo; shot: &nbsp;if the ball goes all the way into the top saucer, that scores from 5K to 40K, advanced by rounds won on the top and left banks; its value resets each ball.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Roller Disco [SS &ndash; Gottlieb, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;UTAD if possible, drop targets otherwise. &nbsp;Shoot the upper left collect bonus saucer when lit if the multiplier is at least 3X.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Roller Disco is all about building, collecting and rebuilding bonus. &nbsp;Base bonus goes up to 20K; build it with all targets, top lanes, upper side lanes and upper flipper return lanes. &nbsp;Each of the A-B-C-D lanes lights a lane for bonus multiplier advance up to 5X: &nbsp;A and D light the left and right upper side lanes respectively; B and C light the left and right upper flipper return lanes respectively. &nbsp;The A and D lanes are linked in 3-ball play (not 5-ball); scoring either awards both. &nbsp;The four multiplier lanes score 15K once your multiplier is at 5X. &nbsp;Bonus can be collected in the top left saucer once base bonus is at 20K; otherwise, that saucer scores 5K. &nbsp;When collected, base bonus resets but your multiplier is preserved. &nbsp;Bonus and multiplier reset each ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Drop targets score 500, but once you complete either 5-bank, targets in that bank are worth 5K. &nbsp;The top A-B-C-D lanes are worth 6K each the first time scored, 3K after that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The strategy to take, if you can, if to shoot the ball up top through the gates between the B and C lanes in order to get all the lanes lit for your multiplier. &nbsp;The shot can only be made from the upper flippers, but it&rsquo;s a narrow gap, and you can&rsquo;t get the ball cradled on those flippers. &nbsp;You should end up getting the multiplier up to 5X when balls coming back down from ABCD go through those upper side lanes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You&rsquo;ll have plenty of shots where you have no choice but to hit drop targets instead. &nbsp;Shots at those will rebound up top anyway and may go up a top lane or down a multiplier lane after banging around in the bumpers. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t mess with the two center standups, though, both they and misses near them are risky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When the ball is coming down the upper outlanes, use the posts at the bottom to deflect it into the lower return lanes. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t over-nudge, though, or the ball will bounce back into the lower outlane.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Rolling Stones [SS &ndash; Bally, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;Saucer at the top left almost exclusively. &nbsp;Nudge balls in the bumper area to collect targets #1-4, then shoot the center #5 target to advance your super bonus. &nbsp;Repeat, but you&rsquo;ll need to hit the post inside either horseshoe to relight the #5 target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Why do I say top saucer all day? &nbsp;The saucer collects bonus and ejects the ball to the top of the machine to collect a ROCK letter. &nbsp;You need to knock down the drop target protecting the saucer first. &nbsp;R-O-C-K lane completions advance bonus multiplier to 2X, 3X, 5X. &nbsp;Bonus X is preserved to subsequent balls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing 1-2-3-4-5 advances the super bonus to 20K, 40K and 60K. &nbsp;The #5 target also scores a ROCK letter when lit. &nbsp;Hitting one of the posts inside either side horseshoe shot relights the #5 target. &nbsp;Regular bonus maxes out at 19K and resets each ball; the 20-40-60K bonus is separate and is held to future balls. &nbsp;With 5X and max bonus, that&rsquo;s 395K for a collect bonus shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The drop target bank on the upper right scores a variable value when completed: &nbsp;the point lights behind them indicate the value to be scored; you want to get the last target to finish the bank when it&rsquo;s worth 25K if you can. &nbsp;The value cycles quickly from 5000 at the bottom upward. &nbsp;Partially completed banks are preserved to the next ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Horseshoe shots in either direction score the current value and raise the value for the next shot up to a maximum of 10K plus 5 bonus advances.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When the ball is not on the right flipper for a saucer shot but on the left one, go up top towards the #3 and #4 targets to try to get those and have the ball bang around in the bumpers and hopefully also get #1 and #2. &nbsp;Of course, you can shoot #5 when lit with the left flipper, too.</span></p><a id="id.qqojp08xh6ip"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Royal Flush [EM - Gottlieb, 1976]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Shoot the left orbit [white lane], trying to get the ball to go through each of the other two colored lanes on the return. &nbsp;Shoot the center drop targets from the left flipper after you have all three colors [keep shooting the left orbit from the right flipper]. &nbsp;Once you&rsquo;ve got the targets, return to left orbit all day from the right, center 5000 target pad from the left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;go for the white joker lane, the center of the three colored lanes at the top left. &nbsp;This lights the long white lane next to these on the left side for 3000. &nbsp;The pink and green joker lanes are the next-best options; either of these lights the same-colored return lane and outlane for 3000. &nbsp;Try to avoid having the ball come down to the right of the triangular piece at the top of the game - - this can lead to a center drain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball on right flipper: &nbsp;shoot left side white lane to get ball back up top into area where you can collect any remaining top color lanes until all three colors are collected. &nbsp;Then shoot drops until finished, then white side lane again. &nbsp;This is most valuable when the left side lane is lit, i.e. after you&rsquo;ve collected the white top lane, but is still the best strategy even when it&rsquo;s not lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball on left flipper: &nbsp;transfer to right flipper until you finish all three colored lanes, then you can use it to hit the drops. &nbsp;Oh, shoot the jacks first (!) since the rebound off of them can go into the &ldquo;open gate&rdquo;

it&rsquo;s good for 3000 when lit, plus you&rsquo;ll have a chance to light the other two colors while the ball is up there. &nbsp;You can also sometimes get an up-and-down for 6000 total.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key Feed: &nbsp;left lane below the 3000 switch - - where does it go? &nbsp;Does it bounce off the rubber post below it and come to the right flipper? &nbsp;Stay right of and miss the post and come clean to the left flipper? &nbsp;Ever go SDTM? &nbsp;Hit the post and go to a slingshot?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once you have all three colors lit, you can start shooting drop targets from the left flipper. &nbsp;These advance your end-of-ball card bonus. &nbsp;If the ball is on the right flipper, stick with the far left lane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shooting the Jack drop targets often rebounds into the right side long lane, opening the gate. &nbsp;The gate saves balls going out the right outlane. &nbsp;This is a good shot to make from the left flipper early in the ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you finish the drop targets, you can shoot the center 5000 pad target, again from the left flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While you can light each of the white, pink and green lanes with the joker standup targets, don&rsquo;t shoot at them - - too risky compared to going up the left side. &nbsp;If the ball bounces into one of them to light it, fine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Last ball strategy: &nbsp;since ball 5 is double bonus, the targets become more valuable if you can complete bonus sets, so shifting to target shots sooner is worthwhile.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Royal Flush Deluxe [SS - Gottlieb, 1983]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;UTAD via the left 30,000 lane, lit or not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As you would expect, similar to Royal Flush the EM, but with a small wrinkle. &nbsp;The SS version has the bonus scores 10 times higher than on the EM, but the pad targets behind the center drops have the same value as on the older game. &nbsp;This means that going for the center 3000 pad once the targets are finished is no longer worthwhile; it pales compared to the left half-orbit shot, which was increased by a factor of 10 along with the bonus. &nbsp;So now it&rsquo;s left 30,000 lane all day once the drops are done, don&rsquo;t even think about the center pad at all for the whole game.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Royal Guard [EM - Gottlieb, 1968]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Hit most of the center moving-rail targets, then UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is a fine example of a &ldquo;deferred UTAD&rdquo; game. &nbsp;There are 5 lettered lanes at the top, A-E. &nbsp;Each lights an outlane for 500 points [base value is 50], corresponding to the outlane positions from left to right, e.g. the &ldquo;A&rdquo; lights the far left outlane [of the two on that side], C lights the center drain. &nbsp;Ideally, you want to get the C first, so you&rsquo;re covered while using the flippers, then get a different letter each ball after that. &nbsp;When draining out the side, remember to nudge to get a lit 500 lane if only one of the two outlanes on that side is lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The primary feature here is the moving center rail of four colored disk targets, blue, red, yellow and green. &nbsp;Each disk lights a feature of the same color in the upper playfield when hit. &nbsp;When the rail is on the left side, the hit target lights a standup target above; when the rail is to the right, it lights a bumper. &nbsp;Once lit, any of these stay lit for the rest of the game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy: &nbsp;hit as many of the rail disk targets as you can to light upper playfield features. &nbsp;Once you&rsquo;ve got most of the features lit, especially the standup targets, go UTAD. &nbsp;Nudge the ball when in the bumpers to try to direct it into any lit standups. &nbsp;And if the opportunity arises to nudge to get the ball to go up a not-yet-lit top lane [A-E], by all means do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The ball will rarely drain directly from the upper playfield; it&rsquo;s a tight angle to the sides, and a relatively small portion of the drop-downs from above go clean down the center without a chance to bounce them off a flipper or post. &nbsp;Most drains happen because you are unable to get control of the ball and it deflects around the lower playfield until going down the center or sides. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is another back-loaded game as far as scoring, i.e. most of your score will come on balls 4 and 5 since you&rsquo;ll have the most features lit then. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t let a bad ball 1 or 2 get to you; if you can get enough things lit later on, you can make a good come back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s an important strategy element to keep in mind. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re the last player and you have two balls left and trail by 900 with the center lane lit, just try to center drain twice for the win. &nbsp;The same idea applies in pingolf situations when you&rsquo;re close to the goal. &nbsp;Unless you have all 5 out lanes lit, any continuation of play risks draining for 50 points rather than 500.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Safari [EM - Bally, 1968]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Irrelevant, but mostly Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A total flailure. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll rarely be able to get any kind of ball control, so just focus on UTAD, with grazing hits off the mushroom bumpers where possible, and through the upper right gate if you can manage it. &nbsp;As indicated at the top of the machine, the Skill Shot is to hit the top sling to light the center lane, then have the ball go in that lane.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Satin Doll [EM - Williams, 1975]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Up Top by going over the rollovers on the upper left side until your bonus is maxed at 10K. &nbsp;Collect the center A-K-Q-J-10 rollovers for 2X and 3X bonus, then UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the 2-player version of Pat Hand. &nbsp;Pat Hand had better playfield art.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This game is somewhat deceptive. &nbsp;Many players focus on the side joker targets or the lit 3000 target among the five in the top center bank. &nbsp;Nope. &nbsp;The big, safe[r] points here come from the rollovers at the very top of the machine. &nbsp;Soft plunge or Skill Shot to get the ball to roll over as many top rollovers as possible before then rolling smoothly over the rollovers above the upper left flipper. &nbsp;When the ball gets to that flipper, shoot it back up top to repeat the roll-down. &nbsp;Rollovers add to your bonus. &nbsp;Once the base bonus is maxed at 10,000, then you can deal with the center cards A-K-Q-J-10. &nbsp;Finishing them once lights the rollovers for 1,000; two completions lights double bonus. &nbsp;Once the rollovers are lit, forget everything else and throw the ball up top whenever you can, shooting along the upper left rollovers from the right flipper and straight up above the top joker from the left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;both sides of the top arc. &nbsp;When the ball dribbles off to the left, does it roll over most of the star rollovers on the left? &nbsp;If yes, get this as much as you can. &nbsp;If not, especially if it misses them all, switch tactics. &nbsp;When the ball dribbles off to the right, how high is the drain risk? &nbsp;Speed matters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for the two bumpers, simply hold the left flipper up at all times when the ball is in them to avoid center bumper-slam drains.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Scorpion [SS - Williams, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;plunge to the left side, then shoot the six drop targets and the 1-2-3 standup targets as many times as possible before having the ball fall between the upper flippers to the lower [main] playfield. &nbsp;Once down below, lock both balls in the two side saucers to start multiball, then do UTAD with both of them when able, complete the main 5 drop target center bank when not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">More complex than many other games of its era, so both the quickie version and this main version will be longer than for most games.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Scorpion is all about multiball and the upper playfield. &nbsp;You want to get off to some early points and plunging the ball to the left is a good way to start. &nbsp;The ball will come to the upper left flipper, from which you want to start nailing the two upper three-drop-target banks. &nbsp;Completing them scores 10K, 20K, 30K, 50K, then special [which we hope is set to be worth points!]. &nbsp;The completion value is held from ball to ball. &nbsp;The 1-2-3 standup targets advance your bottom saucer bonuses, with the &ldquo;1&rdquo; advancing the right saucer, &ldquo;3&rdquo; the left and &ldquo;2&rdquo; both of them. &nbsp;You can fill up both bonuses to maximum value and get 100K plus from the drop target banks before the ball ever reaches the main playfield.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Once the ball is down below, it&rsquo;s all about getting multiball. &nbsp;Scorpion&rsquo;s multiball is set to award points based on how long you keep multiball running, in addition to whatever regular points you score during it. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t just cradle the balls to earn time, though, the count-up timer pauses if you do. &nbsp;You get 1000 points for each second of time at the end of your ball, plus a chance to score level bonuses. &nbsp;At 15 seconds, the right orbit lights for 50K; for 30 seconds, EB, and for 50 seconds, Special. &nbsp;They stay lit until collected, and you can collect all of them with one shot if all three are lit.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">To start multiball, simply lock a ball in each saucer. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll get a collect bonus [one side only] for each shot. &nbsp;When multiball starts, you get a bonus multiplier advance and the center target bank resets. &nbsp;Finishing that bank now will </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Building your bonus multiplier by completing the center drop target 5-bank, which advances it one step to 2X, 3X and 5X, is not the way to go here. &nbsp;Shots at those targets are dangerous, often rebounding out the right side drain. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re best avoided until multiball, when you get one multiplier step advance automatically and then will probably hit some of the targets by accident during multiball. &nbsp;In that case, if you&rsquo;re close to finishing the bank, go ahead and shoot the last target or two. &nbsp;Bonus multiplier is held from ball to ball unless you have 5X, in which case it drops back to 1X.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">One other item about multiball: &nbsp;if you finish that center bank during it, the side outlanes will light for &ldquo;double timer bonus.&rdquo; &nbsp;Drains out either side will then give you twice your earned end-of-ball timer bonus. &nbsp;The timer maxes out at 99 seconds. &nbsp;Your maximum overall end-of-ball bonus is then 10K base times 5X max multiplier times 2 saucer bonuses for 100K, plus 99 seconds times 1K per second times 2 for double timer bonus making 198K in time bonus for 298,000 in total.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Bonus is collected during play each time you shoot the ball into a saucer, both to lock a ball and during multiball, when it will be kicked back out after scoring your bonus. &nbsp;If you have a large bonus and a good multiplier, shooting a lock during multiball can give you a valuable pause in the action that does not stop your count-up bonus timer. &nbsp;Good chance to refocus your play, too.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Other shots: &nbsp;Finishing 4-5-6 lights a bumper each time. &nbsp;The two standup bullseye targets on the left side advance bonus, but if you miss either and hit one of the posts to their sides, you may drain; avoid them. &nbsp;Each pair of return lanes advances bonus, too.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Finishing 1 through 6 twice lights the spinner at the upper left for 1000 per spin. &nbsp;This can provide a notable scoring opportunity if you lock one ball after lighting the spinner. &nbsp;You get a free plunge of the other ball, and a hard-plunge will go through that upper spinner, potentially giving you tens of thousands of points. &nbsp;If you do the hard plunge, though, you may want to raise or hold up the upper left flipper to prevent the ball from rocketing down the center drain.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Scuba [EM - Gottlieb, 1970]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD, but in this case, the goal is less to hit bumpers and lanes than to nudge the game so that the ball hits all five standup targets below the top lanes. &nbsp;That increases the value of all lanes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Style Alert: &nbsp;Go with the Flow!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Scuba is an interesting case, but many feel it&rsquo;s more of a luck-box than most EMs. &nbsp;In this case, rather than collecting a set of lanes to make targets worth more, you&rsquo;re doing the reverse: &nbsp;collecting sets of targets to make the lanes worth more. &nbsp;Here, the five stand-up targets below the top lanes and largely hidden from the flippers by the three bumpers are the key. &nbsp;Completing all five of them scores 500 points and increases the value of three lanes from 50 to 300. &nbsp;Values hold from ball to ball, so finishing them as early in the game as possible is the key to victory. &nbsp;Hitting them is another matter. &nbsp;Only two are directly shootable from the flippers; the center, right and left targets are behind bumpers. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re so important, though, that you must forego all else and try. &nbsp;Your best bet is to try to hit the two open targets on their edges so that the ball bounces sideways; the ideal situation is to get the ball zigzagging at an angle between the three bumpers and the five targets to hit as many of them as possible. &nbsp;Just keep shooting the ball up between the bumpers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once you have several lanes lit &hellip; not much changes. &nbsp;While you can try to shoot the ball up the right- and left-side 50 / 300 lanes from the flippers, I&rsquo;ve found that&rsquo;s not easy to do with the corners there, rather than a curved lane bottom. &nbsp;UTAD seems to work well, trying to get all of the lanes lit, then maybe getting the ball to up-and-down some of the top lanes off of the bumpers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you see the ball heading for the top of the left lane on the right side &nbsp;[the one that drops below towards the flippers, try to nudge the ball off the post over to the outer lane that feeds the plunger. &nbsp;That&rsquo;ll get you lane points plus plunge points. &nbsp;Similarly, on the left side, try to nudge for the outer lane rather than the inner one; the feed from the outer lane is usually cleaner to the left flipper than from the inner lane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since the flippers on Scuba are set at such a low angle, you&rsquo;ll find you have to play this as a flow game. &nbsp;You can almost never get the ball cradled, and if you do, it&rsquo;s not at a good angle for shooting anyway. &nbsp;Use the Bob Flying Backhand a lot to get the ball up top more easily, i.e. flip to backhand the ball as it&rsquo;s approaching either flipper from the opposite side of the machine.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Sea Ray [EM - Bally, 1971]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;shoot the center yellow mushroom bumper to raise the center post. &nbsp;Keep hitting that bumper so long as its value is at least 3000. &nbsp;If bumper value is less than that, shoot up top on the outside of the bumpers. &nbsp;When up top, try to get the ball to enter either side chute.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the 2-player version of Mariner, with slightly different art work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">An interesting game despite its rather basic optimal strategy. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a bonus to build up, but it can only be collected during your ball - - no end of ball bonus. There are three ways to collect it: &nbsp;the top saucer, the right side chute entered from the top by the bumpers, and that same chute entered by a narrow channel near its lower end. &nbsp;Bonus is built up by hitting either of the two green mushroom bumpers, either top white rollover button, and either indicated standup target. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Skill Shot is to plunge hard enough for the ball to go back and forth over the top white rollers to add a bonus or two, then drop into the top center saucer to collect it. &nbsp;Bonus resets to 1000 when collected and maxes out at 10,000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When the ball is in the top bumper area you want to nudge to try to get it to enter either the left hand feature award chute or the right hand collect bonus chute. &nbsp; The left one exits to a fairly safe feed to the flipper, and the right one is kicked back to the top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The left chute has four possible awards, those available at any given moment are indicated by lights. &nbsp;&ldquo;Up post&rdquo; raises the center post between the flippers. &nbsp;&ldquo;Open gate&rdquo; opens the gate at the right outlane to return the ball to the plunger lane. &nbsp;&ldquo;Light blue bumpers&rdquo; raises their value from 10 to 100 points. &nbsp;&ldquo;Light extra ball&rdquo; lights the standup target for it on the right outside the lower end of the chute. &nbsp;The awards cycle on and off with 10 point switches, but the pattern is non-linear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center yellow up post bumper is the safest route to a good score, but it&rsquo;s tricky. &nbsp;Even if you hit it, the rebound may go over one of the two &ldquo;down post&rdquo; rollovers above the bottom slingshots, reopening the center drain. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s worth a value from 1K to 5K as indicated by the lights below it; the value also cycles on 10 point switches, but like the left chute, the pattern is non-linear, although portions of it go in sequence. &nbsp;If it&rsquo;s worth 5k when you first hit it but the rebound hits one of the bottom slings before you can cradle up, the value may have dropped to 1k. &nbsp;This is different than Time Zone, where the value holds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You want to nudge your way to a controlled shot to raise the post, then try to cradle up again. &nbsp;The best way to do this is to make the shot, then so long as the ball doesn&rsquo;t hit a down post button or drain on the rebound, let it settle between the center post and a flipper. &nbsp;Use microflips to get the ball to just enough height above the opposite flipper to raise that flipper to cradle it. &nbsp;Now, you can shoot the center post again or go up top. &nbsp;I tend to shoot the post when it&rsquo;s worth 3k or more, and to go up top when it&rsquo;s only 1k or 2k. &nbsp;The other thing to consider is how much bonus you&rsquo;ve built up. &nbsp;At 10K in bonus, I may go up top at 3k or 4k to try get the ball into the right-side chute to cash in. &nbsp;After all, there&rsquo;s no guarantee that a shot at the center post won&rsquo;t drain on the rebound.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Sea Saw [EM - Bally, 1970]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;UTAD to build bonus with standup targets and top lanes, then hit center standups to make value 10X, then collect bonus at saucers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Bias Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is an almost-all bonus game. &nbsp;The number one thing to note is that there&rsquo;s a 10X multiplier target for each bonus-collect saucer in the center of the playfield that you need to hit BEFORE you shoot either saucer to collect the bonus. &nbsp;The number two thing is that there&rsquo;s no end-of-ball bonus; any value built up in your saucers goes away when you drain. &nbsp;Build it, 10X it, collect it while the ball is in play.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Your strategy needs to start with going up top to build bonus and light things. &nbsp;From the right flipper, shoot at the three standup targets left of the bumpers; this is where most of your work will get done. &nbsp;One target advances each color bonus, the center one opens the bottom ball-save gate. &nbsp;There are two white rollover buttons in front of the targets that also advance your bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You&rsquo;ll want to use the right flipper most of the time, since the left flipper is only useful when you have the top gate open or want to collect the blue bonus on the right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The top lanes have one for advancing each color bonus and two to open the top right gate. &nbsp;Whenever the top gate is open, you want the ball on the left flipper to shoot through it and give yourself another plunge to the top for more advances and or to reopen the gate; the gate also score 3000, the most on the machine other than a 10X bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once you have one or both colors built up close to their 1000 point maxima, you want to hit the center &ldquo;lites 10X&rdquo; targets to raise the value of the saucers. &nbsp;Once lit for 10X, collect them a.s.a.p. since there&rsquo;s no end of ball bonus. &nbsp;Then resume building them; they reset to 100 points when collected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Besides the two gates, there&rsquo;s a center ball save post, with the up button dead center above it and two down buttons above the slingshots. &nbsp;The kickback in the left outlane is lit semi-randomly based on the 10&rsquo;s digit of your score; 4 of the 10 positions will have it on, 6 will have it off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The bumpers are turned on by the top white rollover buttons above the top lanes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill shot: &nbsp;Hit one or both of the rollovers to light a pair of bumpers, then go through either of the two open gate lanes. &nbsp;If a soft plunge will hit the lites green rollover and fall into the top right lane, do that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Don&rsquo;t shoot either of the lower mushroom bumpers to advance bonus.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Seawitch [SS - Stern, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;shoot center target bank for 2X, left bank for 3X, top bank 4X, center 5X, left 6X, top 7X, then do orbits and more drops all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Long version is pretty much the same. &nbsp;Your bonus maxes at 7X and 39K base or 273K total. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s worth going for, of course, but you&rsquo;ll find the top qualifying scores arise not from 3 balls of maximum bonus but from one ball where someone maxed it and kept going for orbit after orbit and bank after bank. &nbsp;The target banks, once completed, either advance your loop [orbit] value or score your bonus value (unmultiplied) for additional completions. &nbsp;Think of it as a mini-collect bonus during the ball. &nbsp;You can get 2M on one ball just by keeping the ball in play and doing orbits and targets long enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The four upper star standup targets each increase the spinner value by 200; get them all to make the spinner 1K per spin, plus whatever loop value you have. &nbsp;Completing all three drop target banks on the same ball lights double value on loop shots. &nbsp;Loop value starts at 1K, rises 1K per target bank to 10K, so that&rsquo;s 20K when the doubler is active. &nbsp;Loops are collected by going over the top star rollover button.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus multiplier is carried over from ball to ball unless you&rsquo;re at 7X;

only the drop targets reset.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lighting 2X bonus lights the spinner on the right, your next point source. &nbsp;Once lit, it stays on the rest of the game. &nbsp;Enjoy the &ldquo;galloping&rdquo; sound it makes, unlike typical spinners.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The highest value shot on the game is the always-lit 50K lane on the left next to the &ldquo;R&rdquo; lane. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s possible, though difficult, to shoot it from the right flipper via going up the 1000 lane below it. &nbsp;This will often get you two 50Ks if you make the shot since the ball often comes right back down the way it went up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The two lower right bumpers can quick-drain you down the middle if you&rsquo;re not alert. &nbsp;A good safety play that looks amateurish but isn&rsquo;t is to simply hold the right flipper up when the ball is in the bumpers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy is to get your bonus multiplier up and spinner lit a.s.a.p., then spinner all day from the left flipper and SHOOTER drop targets all day from the right, plus that 50K shot if you can make it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;balls coming down the 1000 lane left of the drop targets and balls that fall back down after not going all the way to the top on spinner shots.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Sheriff [EM - Gottlieb, 1971]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;Shoot the standup target on the right side but outside the plinko lanes to open the gate, then shoot the ball to the top right and into the plinko lanes. &nbsp;If the gate is still open when the ball exits the plinkos, repeat;

shoot the center horseshoe to multiply your bonus. &nbsp;Once your bonus is maxed, UTAD through the spinners. &nbsp;If EBs are on, shoot the center standup target after you get to 5X for the extra ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Left when the center kicker is not on, otherwise Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;Very Important! &nbsp;Always make the center lane, even if it&rsquo;s not lit for 5000. &nbsp;This lane lights the kickback at the bottom center. &nbsp;This is a potentially 3-way ball saver, since besides rescuing ball draining down the center, balls going out either side are sometimes deflected by small pins towards the center saucer, and then return to play if the saucer is lit. &nbsp;If you fail to get that center lane on the Skill Shot, your first priority is UTAD through the right side spinner until you turn the kicker on. &nbsp;Likewise, since the kicker turns off when triggered, you want to go UTAD again to re-light it after you use it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Each hit on the top bumpers cycles the top lane lights from center-lit to side-pair-lit and back. &nbsp;A perfect Skill Shot will hit the bumpers just enough times to make the center lane lit when the ball goes through it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Silverball Mania was the first game with a tight horseshoe shot for raising your bonus multiplier. &nbsp;Even on a factory game, it&rsquo;s a tight shot; on some tournament machines, the rubber posts at the side of the horseshoe have been replaced with fatter rubbers, making the shot even narrower. &nbsp;Still, that&rsquo;s where you win the game, since besides raising your multiplier, if lights the center bottom saucer to kick the ball back into play, plus you get one or two letters for each shot [two if the ball goes all the way around over both internal rollovers]. &nbsp;Since the only other way to get the &ldquo;M&rdquo; and final &ldquo;A&rdquo; in Mania is through the outlanes, you want that kicker lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you just can&rsquo;t hit the horseshoe, especially if the game has those fat rubbers guarding it, go UTAD and just hope to get the kickback lit if you can get the ball back up to the top center lane after a right spinner shot or via bumper action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Like many other Bally&rsquo;s of that era, this game has a Super Bonus feature where once you complete something, a base bonus is locked in for future balls. &nbsp;In this case, it&rsquo;s 15K for each of the first two complete sets of letters.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Sinbad [EM or SS - Gottlieb, 1978]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Complete the four colored drop target banks, ideally in this order: &nbsp;white [1], yellow [2], purple [3], red [4]. &nbsp;Then UTAD via the left orbit or center spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill shot: &nbsp;the left-most lane at the top for 5000 points; avoid missing all lanes and going down the left side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">I&rsquo;ll cover the more common solid state version first. &nbsp;Target s</span><span class="c2">equence matters a lot. &nbsp;You need the single white target to advance to double bonus; the two yellow targets plus the white one gives you triple; white, yellows and the three purple targets gives 4X; and adding the four red drops makes it 5X. &nbsp;But if you have nine of the ten drops and the one you&rsquo;re missing is the white one &hellip; you&rsquo;re still at single bonus. &nbsp;The order you actually hit them in doesn&rsquo;t matter, just which ones you&rsquo;ve got so far. &nbsp;If you get the white one last but do get it before you drain, you&rsquo;ll still get your 5X. &nbsp;But you want to get them in order in case you drain before you get them all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Each completed target color set also lights the corresponding top lane for the higher value - - the white lane on the right goes from 100 to 1000, the yellow lane from 500 to 5K, purple from 1000 to Extra Ball, red one from 5000 to special [useless in competition]. &nbsp;If extra balls are enabled, one strategy is to shoot for the purple targets first, then flip the ball up top and try to get it to drop through the purple lane to score the extra ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center spinner advances bonus 1K for every 5 spins. &nbsp;Green star rollovers on the upper left advance bonus 1K each when lit; top lanes light them, one for each. &nbsp;Go up top to advance your base bonus and get the drop targets to multiply it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once you finish the drop targets, the accumulated bonus will be collected, and you can rebuild it and collect it again. &nbsp;Base bonus goes up to 15,000, or 75K with the 5X multiplier. &nbsp;After collecting, both the base bonus and the multiplier reset. &nbsp;The bonus counting down can be distracting if you&rsquo;re not expecting it; the best thing to do is go back up top while it counts. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t have to cradle up while it does so, anything you score while it&rsquo;s counting will be kept.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The EM version has different bonus rules: &nbsp;you need to complete all 10 targets to get double bonus, and that&rsquo;s as high as the multiplier goes. &nbsp;The bonus also does not count down and reset; you only collect it at the end of the ball. &nbsp;This means both lower scores and more-compressed scores, i.e. typically a narrower range between competing players.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;first, balls coming down the left side over the rollovers. &nbsp;They&rsquo;ll bounce off the small post below the rollovers and the rebound from that will deflect towards the right outlane. &nbsp;If your plunge goes that way, you might have a house ball; try to avoid having the ball go there, and if it does, try to learn what kind of nudge reduces your drain risk. &nbsp;The other key feed is balls falling through the spinner: &nbsp;you want them to enter the spinner gap either at an angle by rolling down the surface of the panels above it, or if falling fairly straight, at the very right edge; balls falling straight down the left side of the spinner may center drain.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Sing Along [EM - Gottlieb, 1967]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;hit the center target to light the bumper, then either UTAD or, if able, left saucer all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing numbers 1-2-3-4 is good [1&rsquo;s, 2&rsquo;s and 3&rsquo;s score 50, the 4&rsquo;s score 100]; getting lots of saucer collects is better. &nbsp;The saucers kick out from one to another left to right until the right one kicks the ball towards the right flipper. &nbsp;If you can, try to flip from the kickout into the left saucer to repeat the process; if not, UTAD. &nbsp;Ignore the bottom &ldquo;3&rdquo; targets. &nbsp;Hit the center 100-point standup target exactly once, to light the bumpers; ignore it thereafter unless the ball goes through the 50-point &ldquo;bumpers off&rdquo; gate between the upper bumpers. &nbsp;If that happens, go ahead and relight the bumpers with the center target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s a center post between the two central outlanes; use it and try not to flip then - - if you do and you mis-time your flip, you&rsquo;ll drain either down the center or under the flipper. &nbsp;If you do get the ball stuck under a flipper [between the tip of the flipper and the larger posts below the tips], try to do a rapid multiple flip to get the ball to bounce off of the large post and back into play.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Saucers score 10 + 10 per lit number of that color. &nbsp;If you have all four numbers of a color lit, the hole awards an extra ball, if enabled. &nbsp;For instance, the top left &ldquo;1&rdquo; lane, far left central &ldquo;2&rdquo; lane, left side &ldquo;3&rdquo; standup and left &ldquo;4&rdquo; outlane, once collected, lights the left hole/saucer.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Six Million Dollar Man [SS - Bally, 1978]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD, unless you have just one of the three lower &ldquo;0&rdquo;

aim for that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus in $6MDM goes up to a base of 29,000 and a multiplier of 5X for 145K total. &nbsp;Shots falling into the top saucer advance your bonus multiplier: &nbsp;the first two shots just give points, 3K then 5K; the next three shots give 2x, 3X, then 5X; any further shots award 10K. &nbsp;Each saucer shot also awards a bonus advance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You get 50,000 points for completing the five numbers in &ldquo;50000.&rdquo; &nbsp;The &ldquo;5&rdquo; and the first &ldquo;0&rdquo; come from the two top lanes to the sides of the center saucer; the other three come from standup targets on the playfield sides. &nbsp;The game also awards you 5 bonus advances and opens the lower right return gate, so it&rsquo;s very worthwhile to finish it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center post can also be raised by shooting the center standup target; it&rsquo;s riskier than going up top, though, so I don&rsquo;t recommend it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing the drop target bank lights the spinners for 1000 per spin instead of 10 points. &nbsp;I wouldn&rsquo;t bother going for the drops unless you just need one to finish. &nbsp;Additional drop target sets award EBs and specials, if enabled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This game is notorious for short ball times; it&rsquo;s all about end of ball bonus and happening to get a 50,000 set.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Skateball [SS - Bally, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Shoot the S-K-A-T-E drop targets until the right side saucer value reaches 100K, then shoot the saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right until saucer value built up, then Left to collect it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skateball is one of the best solid state games ever made, with a nice mix of useful shots and a unique playfield design. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s mostly about bonus and the saucer on the right side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The S-K-A-T-E drop targets on the left are your top priority from the lower right flipper. &nbsp;Each set advances the value of the saucer on the right, from 20K to 50K, then 100K. &nbsp;They also give you bonus advances. &nbsp;But only complete them twice! &nbsp;A third set finishes &ldquo;B-A-L-L&rdquo; at the right saucer for an Extra Ball when shot, but EB&rsquo;s are usually turned off, and the saucer value resets when shot at that stage. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll then have to start your saucer value over from scratch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus multiplier is advanced two ways: &nbsp;completing the top three lanes [which have flipper-button lane change in the reverse of the usual direction] or completing the three arrow drop targets at the upper left when the green &ldquo;X&rdquo; light below them is on. &nbsp;Base bonus is also advanced by the top lanes. &nbsp;Bonus goes up to 60k, and the multiplier goes up to 5X. &nbsp;Your bonus multiplier is held from ball to ball, so getting it up high early is important. &nbsp;Base bonus is held at 20,000 increments, e.g. if you have at least 20k bonus but less than 40k, 20k is held to the next ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Bonus can be collected during the ball at the saucer and, most importantly, is </span><span class="c17 c5 c9">not</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;reset when collected. &nbsp;You can enable the collect by getting the three upper left drop targets when flashing. &nbsp;[A successful shot will be indicated by the light under that target being lit steady.] &nbsp;The need to complete the upper flashing drops to enable the bonus collect means that it&rsquo;s often wise not to shooting at those targets with the lower flippers until your bonus is significant; just use the upper left flipper, since there&rsquo;s not much else to do with it. &nbsp;Likewise, don&rsquo;t shoot the saucer when collect is lit if you haven&rsquo;t built up much bonus or your multiplier yet - - save it for when it&rsquo;s worth more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feed: &nbsp;the kickout from the right saucer. &nbsp;You have several choices of what to do with it: &nbsp;let it roll uninterrupted, hold the upper flipper up, have that flipper up but drop it as the ball gets to it, or flip away at the Skate targets. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll need to experiment to find which is best, since each game is slightly different. &nbsp;Usually either the hold up or hold-and-drop is best. &nbsp;On many units, letting it roll risks a right side drain or an uncontrolled bounce off the top of the slingshot towards the center. &nbsp;Flipping away risks missing your shot and draining but may be necessary if neither hold option is reliably safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tournament Skateballs will have the wire in the right return lane snipped to make the lane one-way-down only. &nbsp;This is to prevent players from cradling the ball on the right flipper and quick-flipping to make the ball roll up and down that lane to score two bonus advances with almost no risk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Shot management: &nbsp;with the ball on the right flipper, it&rsquo;s almost always best to shoot the Skate targets until the saucer is worth 100K or you have a large bonus value ready to collect there. &nbsp;At that point, try to transfer the ball to the left flipper to shoot the saucer unless you can backhand it from the right flipper safely. &nbsp;With the ball on the left flipper, you have several choices: &nbsp;if the saucer is worth either 100K or a large collect bonus value, shoot the saucer. &nbsp;If not, you can still shoot the saucer, or go up top through the spinner for spin points and to get a lane towards advancing your bonus multiplier. &nbsp;Sometimes, you can use a saucer shot as dual-purpose for both points and a flipper transfer if the kickout can be directed so that the ball ends up on the right flipper. &nbsp;Regardless, learn to make the saucer shot with the left flipper or both.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you haven&rsquo;t played Skateball before, or not often, remember that the left side return lane and outlane are reversed. &nbsp;Also note the unusual layout of the right side outlane and return lanes. &nbsp;Lastly, avoid the center drop target 3-bank.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Sky Jump [EM - Gottlieb, 1974]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;get as many different numbered lanes as you can and shoot lit drop targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Bias Left until you have all of the numbers, bias Right thereafter to shoot drop targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This game starts UTAD, then switches to drops all day. &nbsp;The game is all about the seven drop targets - - lighting them and hitting the lit ones. &nbsp;But unlike most machines, these targets have three factor-of-ten values, not two levels or an add-a-value. &nbsp;Base target value is 50. &nbsp;This goes up to 500 for any target for which you&rsquo;ve scored the lane number corresponding to the target number. &nbsp;Finally, one target is always lit for 10 times more than whichever of these applies; it changes each time you hit the bumper that says in big letters &ldquo;moves 10X target lite when lit.&rdquo; &nbsp;[Can&rsquo;t get much clearer than that! &nbsp;I believe the &ldquo;when lit&rdquo; cycles on the tens digit.] &nbsp;The big points on this game is lighting as many targets as possible, then hitting the lit one, changing which one is lit and hitting the next one. &nbsp;You also get good points [5000] each time you complete the target bank, which then resets. &nbsp;Oh, yes, the numbered lanes collected carry over from ball to ball for the entire game. &nbsp;You will likely score more points on your last two balls than on your first three.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;I prefer to go for the 4 lane first; you then have a chance to nudge the ball off the center bumper towards the upper 1-2-3 lanes and get a second number on the way down. &nbsp;Once you have the 4, get the 7 and 5 next in that order: &nbsp;the 7 gives you a chance to score the right side lanes, while the 5 just drops onto the bumper and starts going random and is riskier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Try not to plunge the ball into the 6! &nbsp;Really. &nbsp;Even if it&rsquo;s the last number you need. &nbsp;If you get it by accident, fine, but avoid getting it from above. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Many Sky Jumps are aligned such that the ball with go straight down the middle fairly often after falling through the top 6 lane. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve seen rare occasions where this happens for the 5 lane instead, so double check that one, too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">How to get the 6 then? &nbsp;Shoot the ball </span><span class="c17 c5">up</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;the 6 from below. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not as hard a shot from the left flipper as you might think, and a successful shot will give you a chance to nudge the ball into coming back down through a different lane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;when the ball comes down either side, where does it go? &nbsp;The right side is mostly one speed, i.e. all the way from the top down, since the ball rarely goes through the gap between standup targets into it. &nbsp;You can probably let it dead bounce off of the left flipper onto the right flipper. &nbsp;You may also be able to drop catch or raise the flipper and cradle up, depending on how far up the flipper it comes. &nbsp;As for the left side, there will be two different exit speeds - - down the 1 [fast] and post-2 or 3 lane [slow]. &nbsp;Learn where the ball goes from each; nudge if necessary to avoid center drains.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Okay, let&rsquo;s assume you have the ball on a flipper. &nbsp;If it&rsquo;s the right flipper and one of the targets is lit for 5000 [both the lane has been collected and the moving light is on it], or you just have one target left to finish the bank, shoot it! &nbsp;Otherwise, shoot the ball up top to either try to collect another lane or move the lit target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If the ball is on the left flipper, you can probably not hit any target left of the 5. &nbsp;If the 5, 6 or 7 is lit for 5K or is that last target, take it, otherwise try a transfer to the right flipper or can shoot the ball up top, through the 6 lane if you can do it. &nbsp;Numbered lanes are worth 1000, so this isn&rsquo;t bad point-wise, either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One move I&rsquo;ve found useful on this game is the flying backhand: &nbsp;when the ball is coming down the right side lanes, you can often time a backhand with the left flipper to hit the 1, 2, 3 or 4 targets. &nbsp;It may or may not be riskier than trying to get control via a catch or dead bounce followed by a shot from a cradle; it depends on your skills and how the rebounds from each target go when shot from each flipper. &nbsp;If the dead bounce won&rsquo;t work [doesn&rsquo;t go far enough and drains down the middle], this is a more viable option.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Yes, that&rsquo;s the other key to this game: &nbsp;watch where your rebounds go off of the targets. &nbsp;Any that drain too often means you need to shoot that target some other way, e.g. with the other flipper, or as the ball is moving down the return lane vs. from a cradle. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is a great game for practicing your nudging and flipper accuracy skills.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Sky Kings [EM - Bally, 1974]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD, with option for captive balls once lit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sky Kings is a mostly-UTAD game, but with an alternate strategy available.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;top saucer, which lights both side captive ball lanes and bumpers. &nbsp;Either side is next best, lighting one color or the other. &nbsp;Dribbling through the center without landing in the saucer is bad news, you light nothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you don&rsquo;t make the saucer Skill Shot, UTAD until you get both captive lanes lit. &nbsp;You can also light the captive ball lanes individually by hitting the mushroom bumpers next to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once you have both lanes lit, you have to choose between two primary alternatives: &nbsp;continue UTAD to score 3000 point saucers plus whatever random points you get while the ball is up there, or shoot the lit captive ball lanes to get 1000 to 4000 per shot, depending upon how far up the captive ball goes. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s rebound drain risk from either strategy, plus brick drain risk, so you need to figure out a few things to help decide:</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c2">When you hit each captive ball squarely, where does the rebound go?</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c2">How many points does a square hit get you, i.e. does the captive ball regularly go all the way up and down for the maximum value of 4K?</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c2">What happens if you miss or hit the captive ball a glancing blow?</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c2">When the ball comes down from up top, how likely is it to drain vs. come to a flipper or through a return lane?</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c2">How readily does the ball go in the saucer when put up top?</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c2">If you miss the top shot, what happens?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Essentially, you&rsquo;re doing a risk-reward calculation on the two. &nbsp;If the top is pretty safe and the saucer friendly, I tend to take that route. &nbsp;If hits to the captive ball fall cleanly into the return lanes, that makes these a good [or better] choice. &nbsp;YMMV;

Elektra would be the other contender.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The playfield is similar to the more common Grand Lizard, featuring a drop target 5-bank on the upper playfield with 5-level timing-based scoring [value locked in at 20K, 40K, 60K, 80K or 100K with first target dropped]. &nbsp;The targets reset if not completed quickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing the top 3-bank when flashing spots a FIRE letter; getting the flashing FIRE letter gives 20 seconds of double scoring. &nbsp;The upper 3-bank lights the loop behind it for 25K, then 50K, then drain shield. &nbsp;You can sometimes score this loop twice by shooting the ball into the loop on the bottom end, where it can go in and up, trip the switch hidden under the plastic, then fall back down that way to trip the switch again rather than continuing out the top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Multiball here is far riskier than on Grand Lizard. &nbsp;You need to complete the lower left target bank or lower center target bank to light a lock. &nbsp;Which order the locks light in appears random. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Two-ball multiball play starts when you lock your second ball in either the lower center or top right saucer. &nbsp;Locking all three balls starts multiball; note this requires locking your second ball in the far left saucer. &nbsp;Subtle!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The top 5-bank scoring is 2X during 2-ball multiball and 3X during 3-ball multiball &hellip; BUT once you lose a ball in 3-ball multiball, your 3X ends even though you still have 2 balls in play &ndash; no 2X then. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s pretty easy to lose one ball quickly while trying to juggle things on multiple levels, so odds are your 3X won&rsquo;t last long. &nbsp;After draining one ball during three-ball multiball, you can relight a lock by completing one of the 3-banks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Collecting S-O-L-A-R letters in the chute at the left between the lower saucers each give you 1 additional bonus X up to 6X max. &nbsp;The lit letter in SOLAR changes continuously, so you may need more than 5 shots to get all the letters. &nbsp;Base bonus goes up to 63K on each side for a maximum of 756K at 6X. &nbsp;Left side is bonus earned during single-ball play; right side is bonus earned during multiball play. &nbsp;Unique!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The game has both magna saves and drain shield. &nbsp;The magna saves are activated by buttons on either side above the flipper button and trigger the magnet above the return lane on that side of the machine. &nbsp;Finishing a 3-bank awards a magna save activation, up to three times per side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The drain shield is activated by completing the upper left target 3-bank three times and activates one outlane as protected (sides alternate). &nbsp;When active, a ball draining through the lit side is returned to play.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball control. &nbsp;The top saucer should kick the ball out to the upper left flipper. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll find that balls that fall just below the upper right flipper but still manage to hit the metal above the center ramp will bounce just enough to be tipped by the upper left flipper and kept on the upper playfield. &nbsp;Keep your left flipper down and ready when the ball goes there. &nbsp;The center ramp is by far the easier route to the top vs. the right ramp. &nbsp;Check before you play to see if the center post between the flippers has been removed or had the rubber taken off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ignore the solar gun captive ball shot.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Solar Ride [SS - Gottlieb, 1979]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD towards the top right gate from the left flipper;

your multiplier is held for the rest of the ball. &nbsp;Like other early Gottlieb SS games, you want to avoid collecting until you have your bonus multiplier up to 4X or 5X. &nbsp;In the case of Solar Ride, where raising the multiplier can take a lot of shots, I&rsquo;d take it at 3X as well if my base was close to maximum.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s not much to the game: &nbsp;shoot the ball up along the right side wall towards the top right gate from the left flippers; shoot the drop targets or, when high enough, the bonus collect saucer from the right. &nbsp;I treat the right side saucer as optional since misses to it can be drainy. &nbsp;If extra balls are on and you have the EB return lane on the right side lit, you can try shatzing for the EB from the left flipper. &nbsp;The EB lights whenever your base bonus is a multiple of 5000; if you collect bonus while it&rsquo;s at such a multiple, the EB lane stays lit until you resume building bonus above the base of 1000. &nbsp;You can also try shatzing left to right for a bonus multiplier advance. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">The wide-open playfield gives you a bit more time to anticipate bad rebounds than on many other games, so learn to see ahead when the ball will bounce towards a drain and use pre-emptive nudging to save it.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;the kickouts from each saucer. &nbsp;The lower right one should kick out to the left flipper. &nbsp;The upper left one will kick out to the right side of the rubber below it; from there, it will sometimes bounce into a bumper and reverse course to the rubber and saucer.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Sorcerer [SS &ndash; Williams, 1985]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Multiball lock shot until you start multiball and have your playfield multiplier at 5X. &nbsp;After that, UTAD except when spinners are lit, then shoot the spinners.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I used to play this at Station Break in Penn Station when passing through New York en route to other cities on the east coast. &nbsp;They never had one at the arcades near me, so I made the most of it;

shoot the lock ramp again to increase your playfield multiplier from 2X to 3X, again for 5X. &nbsp;Once your multiplier is maxed, UTAD. &nbsp;If at some point you complete the letters in SORCEROR, which lights the spinners for 2500 per spin, rip them when in multiball! &nbsp;At 5X, that&rsquo;s 12.5K per spin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Locks can be stolen, and often are;

most shots at them simply go through the spinner without knocking any of them down because the sweet spot is only about a quarter of an inch wide. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re super difficult to hit from the left flipper which has no real angle on them; the right one is your best shot. &nbsp;A precise shot from the right flipper can make a sweeping hit that knocks down all three targets in the bank and continues on through the spinner; that&rsquo;s your best one, if you can do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Another way you can get the spinner advance drop targets is to graze the post below and left of the targets just enough for the ball to bounce sideways into the wall to the right of the spinner. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re lucky, the ball will then rattle sideways between the right wall and the drop targets on the left wall, which can also clear out the whole bank. &nbsp;In this case, the ball won&rsquo;t go through the spinner when it&rsquo;s done but fall back down, hopefully to the right flipper rather than draining down the middle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The spinner starts at 1000 per spin in value, but with each completion of the 3-bank, it goes up another thousand, maxing out at 7K per spin. &nbsp;Most Space Shuttle spinners are pretty juicy, so getting 50K-100K or even more on a good shot is common once your spinner value is high enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Besides increasing the spinner value, finishing the drop targets opens your ball save gate on the lower right outlane. &nbsp;Whenever the ball goes through the gated outlane, it closes the gate, so you want to get the drop target bank again to reopen it. &nbsp;When you start the game, your first goal should be to complete that bank once to open the gate, even before you go for the spinner. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s a two-ball and a three-ball multiball on the game. &nbsp;Start by locking one or two balls in either side saucer. &nbsp;Next, knock down the drop target in the top center in front of the shuttle ramp. &nbsp;Finally, shoot the ball through the shuttle ramp, starting multiball. &nbsp;Ramp shots also raise the center post, protecting you from center drains, but not permanently, it&rsquo;s on a timer and will eventually retract. &nbsp;Ramp shots during multiball score a semi-random value indicated on the backglass. &nbsp;Multiball itself isn&rsquo;t that valuable, but it does give you a better chance to get spinner shots and knock down the targets, especially if you can get two balls in the chute by the targets at the same time; they&rsquo;re more likely to go sideways if they hit each other, and more likely to score those targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The top U-S-A lanes, SHU and TLE standup targets and center T drop target all score points, add bonus or award values shown in the center of the playfield, but treat them as incidental, other than using your flippers to lane change to finish the ABC whenever the ball is up there after a spinner shot. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll get some of them along the way, especially during multiball, but you should not try shooting at any of them. &nbsp;Shoot the 3-bank, shoot the spinner, lock balls and play multiball, don&rsquo;t worry about the other stuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Lock stealing is active on this game! &nbsp;If you lock one or two balls, your op</span><span class="c32">p</span><span class="c2">onents can steal them from you. &nbsp;Keep that in mind.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Space Time [EM - Bally, 1972]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;stop the tunnel on the 5000 value, then shoot the collect tunnel center standup all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot is the collect tunnel lane at the top, but you need to time your plunge so that the tunnel is lit for 5000 when you collect it. &nbsp;The tunnel cycles through values of 1000 to 5000 [look down at the tunnel, you&rsquo;ll see it], stopping when the ball hits the &ldquo;stop tunnel&rdquo; switch near the top of the plunger lane. &nbsp;You can try to soft plunge just up to the stop switch first, then go for the collect plunge after that, but I&rsquo;ve found it&rsquo;s harder to accurately time a soft plunge than the near-full plunge that gets the center collect lane. &nbsp;If you do the one-step near-full plunge, line up the plunger on the right spot on the plunge markers first, then time your release while watching the tunnel lights cycling below.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once the ball is in play, your goal is simple: &nbsp;shoot the center red standup target all day to collect tunnel value so long as the value is 3000 or more. &nbsp;If the tunnel is on 1000 or 2000, you&rsquo;re usually better off shooting the ball towards the gate, if open, the collect bonus on the left [which shoots the ball back up top], or just shooting the ball up top towards the &ldquo;start tunnel&rdquo; saucers to change it. &nbsp;If your plunge fell into one of the start tunnel saucers, or the ball got there after rattling around in the bumpers, the tunnel value will stop again when you hit that center target, or when the ball goes into the &ldquo;collect tunnel&rdquo; pocket on the left side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball control and soft flips are the keys here. &nbsp;Once you&rsquo;ve hit the center target, which raises the center post, you want the ball to settle back down onto a flipper to repeat. &nbsp;The easiest way is to use dead bounces or drop catches to get the ball to settle into the hollow between the tip of a flipper and the center post. &nbsp;Once it&rsquo;s there, use very light flipper taps to try to hop the ball across to the other flipper just high enough to let you cradle it, but not so hard that it goes up and away or triggers a slingshot. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s delicate and requires patience. &nbsp;Breathe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are two &ldquo;down post&rdquo; white buttons near the tops of the slingshots. &nbsp;You want to avoid them. &nbsp;Also, don&rsquo;t be caught off guard if the ball triggers one of them; be ready to flip or try for a trap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While you can use the two &ldquo;start tunnel&rdquo; standup targets to the side of the center collect target to change the tunnel value, the rebounds off of those targets can be really risky, so I&rsquo;d avoid them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The two gates are useful, scoring both points and collect tunnel; take them if you get the chance, but don&rsquo;t go out of your way shooting for them when you have a good tunnel value lit. &nbsp;Each of the two top saucers opens one of the gates.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Spanish Eyes [EM - Williams, 1972]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Center horseshoe all day if the return from it is safe;

players won&rsquo;t earn so many as to make the game play unduly long, so go ahead and leave EBs on as the designers intended.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy is two-fold, one for points, one for EBs. &nbsp;For points, you want to shoot the center horseshoe [5000] and center saucer [1000 for each of the number 1-6 you&rsquo;ve collected]. &nbsp;For the saucer, you need to do some up top work first to get your numbers lit. &nbsp;The real question is how are the feeds from shots around the horseshoe and kickouts from the saucer? &nbsp;With enough numbers collected, the two are similar in value, so it becomes a matter of which one you can best survive the return from. &nbsp;Of course, if you&rsquo;re way more accurate at hitting one than the other, that enters the equation as well. &nbsp;The center saucer usually kicks out towards the right flipper, but not necessarily so that you can drop catch it. &nbsp;Dead bouncing isn&rsquo;t likely to work since the ball rarely goes across to the other flipper, falling onto the bottom bumper instead. &nbsp;Can you get control after the kickout? &nbsp;As for the horseshoe shot, it&rsquo;s likely to come out so that it lands on top of that bottom bumper. &nbsp;What happens next depends a lot on how strong that bumper is. &nbsp;If it&rsquo;s weak, the ball will rattle around a bit and then weakly dribble-drain down the center. &nbsp;If it&rsquo;s strong but the ball tends to come out of the horseshoe at an unfortunate angle, it may do a quick double- or triple-bank shot center drain. &nbsp;What you need is a strong bumper and for the horseshoe feed to hit close enough to the top of the bumper for the bump to kick the ball up where you can flip at it or cradle it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As for extra balls, getting the five A-E letters will immediately add a ball. &nbsp;The other way to earn one is to complete the numbers 1-6 and then shoot the center horseshoe. &nbsp;In each case, the numbers or letters will then reset. &nbsp;That means the number way to EB presents an interesting strategic quandary: &nbsp;when you have 1-6 lit, the center saucer is worth 6000. &nbsp;If you shoot the horseshoe, you get an extra ball, but now the saucer value drops back to 500 points until you hit the numbers again. &nbsp;Which is worth more, continuing to shoot 6000-point saucers or another ball? &nbsp;Finishing 1-6 also lights the outlanes for 5000; these stay lit even if you collect the extra ball but reset for the next ball in play.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Skill Shot is a two-part one: &nbsp;the first part is to roll over the &ldquo;on bumpers&rdquo; button above the center C lane to make the two side bumpers worth 100 points. &nbsp;Part two is the letter choice: &nbsp;plunge for the C on the first ball and then for whichever letters you still need thereafter. &nbsp;I go for the C first: &nbsp;the ball will then hit the 100 bumper directly below the C, which can bump it back up through the C. &nbsp;This may cause the ball to hit that &ldquo;on bumpers&rdquo;

as mentioned above, it may side drain. &nbsp;You have to gauge the strength of the bump.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Spiderman [SS &ndash; Gottlieb, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;UTAD to advance base bonus via left orbit or bank shots off right-side drop targets. &nbsp;Shoot any lit advance bonus lane when possible. &nbsp;If you complete the 1-2-3 to light #2 saucer for collect bonus, try to get it. &nbsp;Shatzing the lit return lanes back and forth is an option if you can do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill shot: &nbsp;the &ldquo;B&rdquo;

that&rsquo;s the only thing on the whole machine worth more than 200, and it&rsquo;s hard to get it anytime afterwards other than through luck and a strategic nudge. &nbsp;Making the skill shot on most of your balls will be a big advantage in a match.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Point values are flat across all standup targets and lanes except the top center: &nbsp;each number is worth 100 at all times. &nbsp;The two &ldquo;spin&rdquo; saucers are worth 200, but these are too small to make shooting at them practical since the ball must usually be moving slowly to fall into them. &nbsp;Your best chance of having the ball go in a saucer is via nudging as the ball is coming down from the top near one of them. &nbsp;Besides points, they spot a random card. &nbsp;The saucers eject the ball upwards at an angle between the bumper and the center triangle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The yellow bumpers are lit by the top right lane and the middle side right lane; the green bumpers are lit by the counterpart lanes on the left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center fan-shaped target is worth 100 unless you&rsquo;ve completed all ten cards, when it becomes worth a special. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s the attraction of playing for games rather than for score, trying to get all ten cards to set up the fan target for replays.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The strategy on the game is UTAD; aim your shots to either side of the two saucers, trying to slip past or just barely graze the bumpers above them so the ball continues on upwards. &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t want to hit those bumpers head on, the rebounds can drain. &nbsp;With any luck, the ball will eventually come down one of the side lanes to light the bumpers. &nbsp;Just keep sending it up top. &nbsp;Do not shoot at the center fan target, nor at the #2 or King standup targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Try shatzing the ball up the opposite return lane to see what happens. &nbsp;If the ball consistently goes up just enough to score it but not so much that you get an up-and-out drain, consider a cross-shatz all day strategy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While a bit of a luck box as far as getting action while the ball is up top, the game does require and reward skill for being able to thread the needle on shots to get to the top.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Spin Out [EM - Gottlieb, 1975]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Up top until the Hole Value lanes are lit, then Roto target for needed numbers, then UTAD, via the side Hole Value / Roto lanes if you can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You want lanes and roto target hits, but each letter you collect increases their value, and that of the roto hole in the center. &nbsp;Going back up top is easier than it looks - - the curved plastics above / outside the bumpers tend to deflect the ball up towards the A-B-C-D. &nbsp;The way to the best points is to complete as many numbers as you can by hitting the two exposed roto targets [you also collect a number when you drain out the side], then either shoot the ball into the saucer in the center or get it through one of the &ldquo;Hole Value When Lit&rdquo; lanes that&rsquo;s lit. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t recall the details of how you light those Hole Value lanes - - I think each one is keyed to one of the lettered top lanes. &nbsp;If so, then you want as many top lanes collected as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tactically, shooting at the center saucer to collect the 1000 plus 1000 per spot value is not worth the risk. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re better off trying to slide the ball up one of the sides lanes or threading the gap between either of those and the bumpers to go up top and try to get the ball to bounce into one of the Hole Value lanes as it comes back down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So, basically, UTAD until you have the Hole Value lanes lit, then shoot at the Roto targets to get numbers you don&rsquo;t have so far. &nbsp;Whenever neither of the two exposed Roto numbers is one you still need, go up top instead. &nbsp;Once you have all [or most] of the seven numbers, UTAD. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Spirit of 76 [EM - Gottlieb, 1975]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Up Top until you have all five letters, then complete the drop targets. &nbsp;With both done, shoot the center saucer for double bonus when lit [it cycles]. &nbsp;Then UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Focus on the drop targets, although if extra balls are on, the lanes can become important, too. &nbsp;More than half of your points in a game can come from bonus, especially if you can double it. &nbsp;Base bonus is 15K, advanced by hitting a drop target or triggering a lit star rollover. &nbsp;Each lettered lane lights a star rollover [the one nearest each lane]. &nbsp;Scoring all five letters lights center saucer for Extra Ball on a digit cycle; all 8 drop targets lights the saucer for double bonus on the cycle; completing both the targets and the lanes lights it for special on cycle. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a way to get 4x bonus: &nbsp;light double bonus in the saucer, score it, relight double bonus in the saucer, shoot it. &nbsp;Since you already have double bonus lit, it instead awards you 4X bonus. &nbsp;This is the most valuable shot in the game. &nbsp;End of ball bonus is doubled if you&rsquo;ve made the doubler shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;make the C. &nbsp;Even if EBs are off, the C shot will light the center star rollover for bonus advances, and you should get at least one right away when the ball exits the C lane over it. &nbsp;As for the other letters, if you get them, fine, but don&rsquo;t bother shooting at them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The rebounds from hitting the drop targets are risky, but you need to shoot them, so plan on quick reflex nudging to save drain-bound bounces.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Spy Hunter [SS &ndash;

get the drops again to reopen it. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t bother actively shooting at these targets; you may get them by accident. &nbsp;The saucer and the top are worth more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The saucer, once qualified by the 50K skill shot or completing the S-H-O-T targets, awards 25K to 250K, going up in value each time it&rsquo;s scored. &nbsp;Completing SHOT also lights the spinner in front of the saucer, but only for one shot through it. &nbsp;This saucer is your go-to shot! &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll do well if you can hit the saucer, trap the kickout from it on the right flipper, backhand the saucer again and repeat that ad nauseum.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When the ball goes in the upper left &ldquo;warehouse&rdquo; area, nudge to hit as many different rollovers as possible. &nbsp;The right flipper button serves as a rollover lane change for these. &nbsp;The lit rollovers are your end of ball bonus, 10K for each up to 90K;

on when you make either saucer shot. &nbsp;The catch is, any shot to change the saucer value may rebound and change it again before you get the ball back on a flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The strategy here is up top via the spinner until you collect each of the different saucer values at the top hole. &nbsp;Keep that up until your bonus is maximized. &nbsp;Even then, stay with it since one good lit spinner shot plus random points up top is worth far more than the captive ball or any of the standup targets.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Star Action [EM - Williams, 1974]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD, with optional spinner risk once your base bonus is maxed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the add-a-ball version of Triple Action with different scoring.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Skill Shot is to hit as many of the top disk &ldquo;advance bonus&rdquo; rollovers as possible before having the ball drop into the lit advance spinner lane. &nbsp;The lit lane changes as the ball hits the side rubbers at the top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After that, go up top until your base bonus is maxed out at 100,000. &nbsp;Once the base bonus is maxed, if you&rsquo;re close to completing the center spinner to increase the bonus multiplier, go up top again and try to get the lit lane to finish it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The fastest way to increase your bonus multiplier is to shoot the spinner. &nbsp;If the spinner is not too lively, though, ignore it and stick with UTAD for the lit lane. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d say to ignore the spinner completely, except that UTAD will eventually drain when the ball comes out of the top bumpers the wrong way towards those gaping no-return-lane sides or straight down the middle, so since one good whack to the spinner can be worth several top shots as far as advancing the spinner goes, it can be less risky statistically to take one spinner shot than those several top shots. &nbsp;The spinner shot is best done when the spinner posts are near the 3 o&rsquo;clock and 9 o&rsquo;clock positions to maximize the number of spins a hit to it gets you. &nbsp;Also, try to hit the outside edges of the posts: &nbsp;you want the rebound to go sideways and up rather than down towards an outlane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unlike the replay version where you should ignore the A-B-C-D completely, the add-a-ball version makes the drop targets worthwhile! &nbsp;If add-a-balls are on, completing them twice on one ball awards an extra ball. &nbsp;If extra balls are off, you get 100K for each time you complete the set. &nbsp;Either way, they&rsquo;re now worth shooting at. &nbsp;When you have your bonus maximized at 100K and 3X, shoot the drop targets all day. &nbsp;I suggest making the A and B first, either by going up top and nudging to bounce the ball into A and B as it falls through the top lane onto a bumper, or via bank shots at them using the rubbers at the sides of the game near the spinners as your banking walls. &nbsp;You can sometimes get both the A and B with a double bank shot that way. &nbsp;After you have A and B, go for the riskier C and D drop targets. &nbsp;Repeat.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Star Gazer [SS &ndash;

they&rsquo;re lit until you collect them. &nbsp;The star rollovers next to each flipper award a zodiac letter when either the top or third light on them is lit. &nbsp;Completing the zodiac symbols lights your 12K Super Bonus and you go on for another 12 to get to a 24K light, then on to have both the 12K and 24K lights lit for 36K. &nbsp;You can get 11 more in a third set before it rolls over, or 47K maximum base bonus. &nbsp;Base bonus is held.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus multiplier is raised by completing either of the lower two drop target banks. &nbsp;The multiplier goes up to 10X; its current value is the sum of the 1-2-3-4 bonus lights. &nbsp;Max bonus is thus 470K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Drop target values go up each time they&rsquo;re hit, from 1K until they&rsquo;re worth 4K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The two flipper rollover lights that don&rsquo;t spot targets each light the spinner opposite the flipper. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s possible to use a quick, short jam flip when the ball is cradled to make it go backwards over the rollover to score a zodiac item or light a spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The upper left spinner value cycles until you lock it in by hitting one of the 3-bank drop targets right of it. &nbsp;That shot both locks in the spinner value between 500 and 4000 per spin and the locks in the value of completing the 3-bank between 5K and 50K. &nbsp;The two run opposite each other in pairs, i.e. the highest spinner value goes with the lowest target bank value and vice versa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The lower left spinner and the right spinner are fixed at 200 in value unless you light the spinner by the flipper rollover, in which case they&rsquo;re value goes up tenfold to 2K per spin. &nbsp;The 10X light goes off once you hit a 10X shot when the spinner stops spinning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy is to light the lower spinners and rip them, and try to stop the upper left spinner value on 4000 and rip that. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll get the zodiac letters without trying if your ball lasts long enough via random hits into them off the bumpers and flipper rollovers. &nbsp;Once you have enough base bonus, try to finish the drops to advance your multiplier.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Star Light [SS - Williams, 1984]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: Hit the STAR targets to light the lock on the right, lock the ball, play multiball. &nbsp;During multiball, UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: Left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Star Light is relatively rare, but a lot of fun to play. &nbsp;Multiball is the winning strategy and is easy to start, but can be hard to maintain at times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Star Light has manual lit-lane change, but uses an extra button above the right flipper for it. &nbsp;On other machines with lane change, one or both flipper buttons do this; here, it&rsquo;s a separate button positioned where the button for an upper flipper would typically be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The ten numbers for the top lanes correspond to the ten star rollovers in the center of the playfield, as on Laser Ball. &nbsp;Completing all ten, whether by top lane or rollover, lights a &ldquo;constellation&rdquo; for 10K in base bonus. &nbsp;Maximum base bonus is 69K (six constellations plus nine leftover stars).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The S-T-A-R standup targets at the top right light the small lock saucer on the right. &nbsp;The targets are easily hit from either flipper, since cradled backhand shots go straight up at them. &nbsp;You also get 10K for each completed constellation when you finish STAR.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing the five LIGHT standup targets, two on the left, three in the center, lights your spinner for 1K per spin; a second LIGHT makes the spinner 2K. &nbsp;Each time you score Light, the value for completing it goes up: &nbsp;5K, 10K, 30K, 50K, 100K. &nbsp;Getting both STAR and LIGHT holds your bonus. &nbsp;If you earn hold bonus on your last ball, rather than get one additional count of your last-ball bonus, you get a timed extra ball of 10 seconds per constellation and 1 second per star.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus multiplier is advanced by hitting whichever of the upper left standup target, lower right standup target and right orbit is lit. &nbsp;Multiplier goes up to 5X for total bonus potential of 345K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Multiball is the strategy here. &nbsp;Once you lock a ball, you plunge the other ball and any switch hit starts multiball. &nbsp;The eject hole itself scores 3K per lit star. &nbsp;During multiball, scores are doubled;

the other way to get A and B is from shots to the top where the ball falls down the center into the middle bumper and bounces off of it into the A and or B. &nbsp;C and D are direct shots from the flippers, although you can also collect these randomly off sling bounces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You also get a bonus advance for each trip through either of the return lanes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once your bonus is at double 15K, UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Don&rsquo;t bother to shoot the spinner;

likewise for triple bonus. &nbsp;There is no end-of-ball bonus!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are three gates on the game: &nbsp;left, right and bottom. &nbsp;All three are opened by shots to the center saucer when the arrow is on their respective positions. &nbsp;Balls through the right outlane score 5K and are returned to the plunger when the bottom gate is open. &nbsp;Balls through the right side lane score 5K and exit through the right gate to the plunger lane when the right gate is open. &nbsp;The left gate is positioned sideways at the base of the slingshot &hellip; you don&rsquo;t want it open! &nbsp;Balls through it may drain out the left. &nbsp;Both the right and bottom gates are worth scoring when possible due to those 5K values, big on this game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There is also a center post, raised by either of those two yellow standup targets next to the center saucer. &nbsp;Small rollover buttons to the left and right of the wheel lower the center post. &nbsp;When shooting to raise the post, try to hit the up post targets dead center. &nbsp;If you must miss, miss to the inside; hitting the outer edges of the up post targets can rebound to a side drain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The saucer value advances one step clockwise around the circle each time you hit an advance bonus switch. &nbsp;Bonus is collected by saucer shots at base value by two positions, double and triple by one position each. &nbsp;Both the top and center saucers score the wheel value. &nbsp;Bonus and multipliers reset;

100K for specials, but only one special per ball; and unlimited 100K specials. &nbsp;Which you&rsquo;re dealing with will determine the best strategy. &nbsp;If unlimited 100K specials are on, getting them outranks everything else on the machine. &nbsp;Get all five stars, then shoot the lit red star as many times as you can before the ball drains; which star is lit will change with switch hits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If specials are on but you can only get one per ball, get that first special. &nbsp;What&rsquo;s next depends on how good the right spinner is. &nbsp;If you get lots of spins per shot, do right side spinner all day after that special; it will be worth 1000 per spin then, since you have all five stars. &nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t get many spins, go for the drop targets to build your bonus multiplier and raise the value of the left spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">If specials are off, </span><span class="c17 c5 c9">or</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;if one or more of the star targets proves difficult to hit or reluctant to register anything but a perfect hit, it&rsquo;s drop targets all day. &nbsp;Drop target banks raise your bonus multiplier, and the target value goes up once you&rsquo;ve completed them enough times. &nbsp;Get either three-bank of drop targets to advance your multiplier to 2X; once you have 2X, get both banks for 3X. &nbsp;Bonus is built via the return lanes, star stand-up targets, and the two small button rollovers, one at the machine&rsquo;s top, the other in the center. &nbsp;Lit bottom lanes award 3 bonus advances instead of just one. &nbsp;Base bonus maxes at 19K for a total max of 57K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The spinners start off worth 200 per spin; the right one goes up 200 per star, so all five stars makes that 1K per spin. &nbsp;The left spinner goes up in value when you complete the drop target banks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Check to see if the center post has been left intact in your game; it may be there with rubber on it, it may be there with no rubber, or it may have been removed. &nbsp;If it&rsquo;s there with rubber, you may be able to transfer the ball from one flipper to the other by just letting the ball roll down the end of the flipper, bounce off the center post and roll just a bit up onto the opposite flipper.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Stellar Wars [SS &ndash;

Stellar Wars letters reset.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing the upper right drop target 3-bank three times lights the spinners. &nbsp;Shooting at the drops from the flippers is more dangerous than you&rsquo;d think, though, as rebounds down the middle are not uncommon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Center targets advance the left saucer value, but this is generally not worth doing. &nbsp;If you do happen to get the saucer value up to 10K, go ahead and shoot it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bumpers are tri-valued: &nbsp;100 unlit, 1000 lit, 2000 flashing. &nbsp;Completing the left side drop target 3-bank once lights them; twice flashes them. &nbsp;When you have flashing bumpers, making the spinner shot to the top is even better since that feeds the bumpers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">General strategy is UTAD via the spinners even before they&rsquo;re lit to get bonus base and multipliers from 1-2-3-4. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t bother with other things unless random shots and bounces have gotten you close to completing them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Be careful when the ball is near the WARS letters; the return lane divider heights are staggered, so balls not going cleanly into a return lane may rattle into the outlanes on you.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Stingray [SS - Stern, 1977]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD and nudge for the 55,000 feature from the top saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right if the flippers are weak [common], Balanced if strong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;Top saucer, ideally for 55,000; next best choice is double bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This game is a bit too luck-based for my taste but is still used in tournaments. &nbsp;The luck issue comes from the saucer values, which cycle between five values: &nbsp;5000+ light spinner and Stingray lane; 5000 points only; light double bonus; 55,000 points; and 5000+light extra ball lane. &nbsp;The player has no control over which one is lit when they plunge the ball, though. &nbsp;This mean that a player who makes the Skill Shot just once out of three tries and has the 55K lit when they do it can outperform their opponent who goes 3-for-3 but has something lesser lit each time. &nbsp;The same goes for all of their UTAD flipper shots: &nbsp;a handful of successes with 55K lit beats many more successes with other awards lit. &nbsp;The Extra Ball award is useless unless EBs are on. &nbsp;The 5000 award is chump change, and the 5000 plus spinner isn&rsquo;t much better unless the spinner is really juicy. &nbsp;Double bonus can be useful, but bonus advances are harder to come by on Stingray than on most other games, so its value is uncertain. &nbsp;That 55K award trumps them all and tends to win the game if you manage to get it several times. &nbsp;Sadly, skill can&rsquo;t light the saucer for 55K for you; you just keep changing the value and hoping it stops there long enough for you to take a shot at it before it changes again. &nbsp;If one or more of your opponents just keep happening to have the value stop on 55K a lot, and you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re basically screwed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The other issue I have with Stingray is that most Stingrays I&rsquo;ve played in the past decade have not been maintained well. &nbsp;On Stingray, a good shot at the Stingray button lane on the right should go all the way to the top of the game and have a chance to settle in the top saucer. &nbsp;Ninety+ percent of the ones I&rsquo;ve played can&rsquo;t do this; the ball goes partway up, maybe gets to the uppermost rollover, then stops and falls back down. &nbsp;This takes away a major strategy of the game; you should be able to UTAD from either flipper, through the spinner on the left and the Stingray lane on the right, trying to collect the top saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The strategy, if you have to play it, is UTAD for the saucer and pray for 55K, or at least double bonus, to make it worthwhile. &nbsp;Switch hits for 10 points move the lit item around the values shown in the circle [not necessarily in clockwise order]. &nbsp;Notice that the top left rubber left of the upper saucer is one switch that moves the saucer value, so account for that if your plunge will trigger it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The saucer in the center of the game has matching values to the top saucer at all times, but it&rsquo;s a high risk shot due to how tight it is and the drain risk from misses hitting the sides or rim-outs or rejections on shots at it. &nbsp;Successful shots into it, or when the ball falls into it from above, should be kicked out towards the left flipper. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The end of ball bonus maxes at 100K base and 2X. &nbsp;The only ways to get bonus before the ball drains [the two outlanes each give one advance] are either going over that little red disk just above the flippers or hitting the standup target in the alcove on the right side just left of the Stingray lane. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t bother trying for either; the standup shot is risky, and the rollover will get triggered a few times anyway as the ball bounces around the playfield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Stingray lane has some value once you&rsquo;ve lit it, 1000 per disk hit on the way up. &nbsp;Likewise, the spinner is worth 1000 per spin when lit. &nbsp;You can grind on these for some points, but it takes a lot of shots to them to match one 55K saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If Extra Balls are on, by all means try to get one, even over going for a 55K collect! &nbsp;Light it with the top saucer when indicated; collect it in one of the return lanes; which lane is lit also toggles with switch hits.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Straight Flush [EM - Williams, 1970]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;left orbit all day</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Shot to Master: &nbsp;Left Orbit</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill shot: &nbsp;get any lit lane at the top; the harder ones are to the left, so try to get those first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">On Straight Flush, the goal</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is to collect all five cards. &nbsp;Each has a lane at the top, but they can also be scored via the center saucer. &nbsp;You get 100,000 [or an extra ball, depending on settings] for the set of five. &nbsp;You also get 100K for scoring all three jokers via the center saucer, and 100K for the left orbit when lit for Special.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Each top lane or card lights the bumper below it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On the right side are Up Post and Down Post standup targets, which raise and lower the center ball-save post. &nbsp;Like many other games with center posts, you can let the ball settle between either flipper and the post when it&rsquo;s up, then use soft flips to set up shots.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center saucer scores the card indicated by the pointed arrow below it. &nbsp;The arrow moves one position clockwise whenever you hit either of the two Advance standup targets near the top or go over either advance rollover button. &nbsp;The arrow does not advance when you score the saucer. &nbsp;You also score the arrowed card when the ball goes through the &ldquo;spot card + 5000&rdquo; lane on the left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Ace lights the left outlane for 5K, the ten lights the right outlane; no big deal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since the left orbit shot scores 10,000 even when not lit, that&rsquo;s your go-to shot all day. &nbsp;Lighting it for Special is pseudo-random; it goes on and off based on 100&rsquo;s digit of your score, apparently lit for two digits out of the ten. &nbsp;You may find that shots up top via the left orbit tend to bounce into one or two of the card lanes more often than the others. &nbsp;If so, skew your plunges to get the other cards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Don&rsquo;t worry about the center saucer; the ball will wander into it periodically after bouncing around in the bumpers. &nbsp;Treat getting cards or jokers from the saucer as a fringe benefit but not a goal. &nbsp;The kickout from it should go cleanly to the left flipper.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Strange World [EM - Gottlieb, 1978]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;collect all four numbers in all three places, then UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Mild bias Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">The key is to collect </span><span class="c17 c5 c9">sets</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of numbers - - one from the top lanes, one from the green standup targets [or disk rollover at the top for #4], and one from the yellow stand-ups [or right side lane for #2]. &nbsp;Getting all three of a number increases the value of any shot for that number from 500 to 5,000. &nbsp;Bumpers are 1000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Skill Shot would be for either the 2 or the 3, since scoring either awards both top lanes. &nbsp;This also applies for the green 2 and 3 stand-up targets, i.e. getting either gives you both. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s therefore easier to &ldquo;finish&rdquo; your three 2&rsquo;s or 3&rsquo;s first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once you have all [or most] of the numbers, just go UTAD and get the ball to fall into any 5000-valued lane. &nbsp;Best choice is the #4 lane, since that one feeds the #2 lane below it and provides a relatively safe return to the flippers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Strato-Flite [EM - Williams, 1974]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD, via bank shots off the A and D standup banks. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Skill Shot: &nbsp;land in the top saucer, ideally for open bottom gate [1</span><span class="c5 c23">st</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;choice] or 5000 points [2</span><span class="c5 c23">nd</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;choice];

a LOT. &nbsp;if the bottom upkicker deposits the ball into the central &ldquo;stop clock&rdquo; saucer, shoot letters when the clock is stopped. &nbsp;Drain and re-Skill Shot when it would take too long to do something useful with the ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ah, Summer Time / Travel Time. &nbsp;The &ldquo;forever or crap&rdquo; game. &nbsp;My best score on this is a bit over 11 million - - yes, rolling it 110 times in one game [I played it literally all day - - not the same quarter, the same game - - and only stopped when the arcade closed for the night.] &nbsp;But it can also be almost unplayably bad. &nbsp;Read on and be amazed, disgusted or both.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Skill Shot is to make the center lane to add 10 time units. &nbsp;This is THE MOST IMPORTANT thing about the entire game. &nbsp;Learn this or lose miserably.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The game runs on time, not balls. &nbsp;You start with 1:30 on the clock; the clock starts running as soon as the ball goes through one of the top three lanes. &nbsp;You can stop the clock by shooting the ball into the center saucer; this is your single most important shot on the game. &nbsp;The clock is restarted by either of the red rollover buttons to the sides of the center saucer area and by the upkicker between the flippers. &nbsp;The clock also stops when the ball drains out either side, but if the ball drains out the middle, e.g. between the flippers and the upkicker, the clock doesn&rsquo;t stop until the ball is in the bottom trough, so try to not to drain down the middle. &nbsp;If you see that a center drain is unavoidable, in some cases you can slap the ball backwards with a flip-and-release to get it to drain quicker!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Besides the top center lane, time is added to the clock when you complete the set of six top T-R-A-V-E-L standup targets or the four mid-playfield T-I-M-E targets and then get the ball to drop into the upkicker. &nbsp;Each is good for 25 time units. &nbsp;The clock maxes out at 2:55, so if you&rsquo;re close to that and have the upkicker lit, shoot more letters before using it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Basic strategy: &nbsp;make the Skill Shot every time you plunge. &nbsp;During play, shoot for the letters to finish them, then let the ball roll down off a flipper into the upkicker to cash in and add time. &nbsp;In most cases, the upkicker will then throw the ball into the stop clock saucer, which then kicks the ball out towards the right flipper. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve just added 25 seconds and stopped the clock; shoot for more letters, i.e. rinse and repeat. &nbsp;When you go up top, try to go around the start clock buttons, of course. &nbsp;You can also get the ball up top with a too-hard shot to the center saucer that can go through into the bumpers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key things on this game are the kickouts, especially how often the upkicker successfully plops the ball into the stop clock saucer. &nbsp;If that percentage isn&rsquo;t high, games will be short since direct stop-clock shots are both difficult and often go through as mentioned. &nbsp;Also, the machine&rsquo;s pitch is critical: &nbsp;if the game is too shallow or floaty, the ball will take too long to do things while the clock is running, and you won&rsquo;t be able to earn time faster than it&rsquo;s used up. &nbsp;In this case, a viable strategy is to just Skill Shot and drain all day, i.e. let the ball go out as quickly as you can and hope it averages less than 10 time units before doing so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Points, oh, yes, points. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s all about the saucers and top lanes. &nbsp;The stop clock one is worth 5000 when lit, and the upkicker, when you have a set of letters completed, is also 5000, otherwise the upkicker is 500. &nbsp;Top lanes are 2000 for the center and 1000 for each side. &nbsp;The rollover buttons, targets, slings and bumpers don&rsquo;t add much unless you have very active bumpers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball control is key - - managing the clock means not cradling the ball when the clock is running. &nbsp;Flailing just wastes time you haven&rsquo;t got to spare. &nbsp;Do one of three things: &nbsp;take controlled, well-aimed shots; coax the ball dribble into the upkicker; or try to drain a.s.a.p.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Super Flite [EM - Williams, 1974]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD, via bank shots off the A and D standup banks. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the 2-player version of Strato-Flite.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Skill Shot: &nbsp;land in the top saucer, ideally for open bottom gate [1</span><span class="c5 c23">st</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;choice] or 5000 points [2</span><span class="c5 c23">nd</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;choice];

the further back you push it, the better, up to 50,000 plus 5 advances. &nbsp;You also get double bonus if you&rsquo;re able to get an all-the-way-back level 6 shot to the vari-target; that can be huge, so see if the flippers are strong enough to do it. &nbsp;See where the ball rebounds after you hit the vari-target; you may be able to get the ball back to a cradle on the left flipper after your shot. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The other bonus-building strategy is shooting the right side spinner, which is usually a safer shot than the vari-target when you miss. &nbsp;The ball will continue up into the bumpers, which also give good value of 10,000 when lit [1000 unlit]. Slingshot hits toggle the bumper lights, as well as the top lanes at times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To collect your bonus, nudge the ball towards the upper right always-open gate; going through it collects [and resets] bonus and gives you a free plunge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If the bumpers are lit, the spinner/bumper option is the better one. &nbsp;I also prefer the spinner when I&rsquo;m nearing maximum bonus, since shots through it have a chance of bouncing through the collect-bonus gate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s also a lower gate, opened when the ball goes through the left return lane, so nudge the ball into that when you can. &nbsp;Shots through the upper gate will close the lower gate if it&rsquo;s open.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Base bonus maxes out at 190,000 and is doubled on the last ball.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Ignore the 30,000-point standup target on the right.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Super Spin [EM &ndash;

the left standup scores the left roto target, the top right saucer for the center roto, the lower right standup for the right roto. &nbsp;The center one awards ten times value, so it&#39;s the only one really worth getting. &nbsp;Since the two side roto targets aren&rsquo;t at 10X, there&rsquo;s little point in shooting at either of them or at the standup targets that award them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The top lanes and the vari-target all spin the roto to display different values.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;the return from the bullseye target and rebounds off the roto targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While the vari-target awards up to 5 bonus advances, it&rsquo;s a drain risk and I wouldn&rsquo;t bother with it. &nbsp;Let your bonus build up from the bullseye, the center roto target, the return lanes and random bounces or missed shots. &nbsp;Just shoot the center roto and the bullseye all day. &nbsp;If the ball ends up in the bumpers, try to nudge it into the collect center roto saucer. &nbsp;Use dead bounces and shatzes to get the ball to the right flipper. &nbsp;See if you can backhand the center roto from the left flipper if it&rsquo;s difficult to transfer the ball to the right.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Super Soccer [EM - Gottlieb, 1975]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD - - through the spinner from the left flipper, and from the right flipper to the collect bonus saucer or, if the ball continues past that, the mystery add bonus saucer. &nbsp;Rinse and repeat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Mild bias Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One of the few games that use a backglass-held plastic ball rail to track your accumulated bonus. &nbsp;In each case, bonus max is 10,000 [ten balls]. &nbsp;Like &ldquo;300&rdquo;, it has a mystery saucer that adds 1, 2 or 3 bonus advances, subject to the bonus max of ten.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s a ball save gate on the right outlane, activated by getting the right side lane in the mid-upper playfield. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t shoot it directly, but you can try to nudge the ball into it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The two standup add bonus targets above the return lanes are not worth shooting at. &nbsp;You should also avoid hitting the bumpers directly from the flippers, other than a grazing hit on the left edge of the left bumper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Double bonus is scored on the last ball but cannot be lit on other balls.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Super Star [EM &ndash;

disk rollovers next to the swinging target protect against center drains until you hit a &ldquo;down post&rdquo; rollover.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center swinging target is the other high-value item, but it&rsquo;s a risky shot due to the randomness of rebounds off it or, when you miss, the rubber behind it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">House balls are common on this game, often when the ball rolls off the center triangle above the swinging target and drains out either side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you get the center post up, let the ball settle onto it and use micro-flips to set up your shots. &nbsp;Best strategy is UTAD, aiming just to the inside of either down post rollover [you want to miss them].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The winner of the game is usually the player who gets the most lucky bounces from the bumpers into the saucer when the saucer is lit for 5000. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s also a lot of luck in draining, i.e. which value the center target is on when you drain [with or without the kicker or gate lit]. &nbsp;After the Skill Shot, 80%+ of the large points earned tend to be random. &nbsp;Even lighting the bumpers, which can add up with enough time up top, is a matter of a lucky or nudge-assisted bounce into the &ldquo;on bumpers&rdquo; standup targets - - you can&rsquo;t shoot them directly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">This is also a game where you way </span><span class="c17 c5 c9">want</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;to drain the ball prematurely if you&rsquo;re not far behind and you have triple bonus lit. &nbsp;If the swing target is on the 5000 indicator, letting the ball drain then nets 15,000, which is big points here and could win you the game. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve done just that occasionally, and I&rsquo;m not the only one to win that way.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Tag-Team [SS &ndash; Gottlieb / Premier, 1985]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;Complete TAG and TEAM targets to lock balls, play multiball. &nbsp;During multiball, UTAD, through the lit spinner when possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Complete the T-A-G drop targets in left to right order to light the upper left lock. &nbsp;Complete the lower right T-E-A-M drop targets in order to light the lower right lock. &nbsp;Watch out for the rebounds off the TEAM targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once both balls are locked, shoot the &ldquo;Release&rdquo; horseshoe on the left to start multiball. &nbsp;Multiball scores 3X playfield. &nbsp;Now, go up top. &nbsp;The left return lane lights the spinner for 10K; that makes a lit spinner 30K during multiball, half a million on a good rip. &nbsp;With the right flipper, shoot for the top left lock saucer and then when the ball kicks out of that, shoot for the gate to the top lanes to advance your bonus multiplier and work towards a special.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One nice feature of Tag Team is that a locked ball serves as a potential ball save! &nbsp;If you drain out the lit left &ldquo;last chance&rdquo; outlane with one ball locked, the locked ball is released and play continues.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus goes up to 29K, not 39K. &nbsp;Every Tag Team I&rsquo;ve played or watched online has a bug in the bonus value lights. &nbsp;When you go from 19K to 20K in bonus, the 10K light stays on. &nbsp;No, you haven&rsquo;t got 30K. &nbsp;While the 1K-9K lights will still go on to indicate progress from 20K to 29K and are additive to the 20K, the 10K is not additive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus multiplier goes up to 5X, increased by completing the top three lanes. &nbsp;Once base bonus reaches 20K, one of the lock saucers or the release will light to collect bonus (with multiplier). &nbsp;Only one is lit at any time, cycling between these three shots on slingshot hits. &nbsp;After a bonus collect, the base resets but the multiplier remains.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This game has the lane light indicators reversed from normal: &nbsp;you need to have the ball go through the lit lane to unlight it!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Extra balls and specials should be off and award 500K instead; that makes them very worth getting! &nbsp;You can get the special in the lit top lane from any of the three flippers: &nbsp;from the lower left via either the spinner, the upper left by shooting through the gate right of the &ldquo;G&rdquo; target, and the lower right by shooting the gap left of the &ldquo;T&rdquo; in TAG. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s also a special standup target above the upper flipper. &nbsp;For the Extra Ball, it&rsquo;s that shot left of the &ldquo;T&rdquo;, lit by making multiple timed shots through it immediately after the ball goes through the right return lane (there is no right outlane).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While the TAG targets are best shot with the upper flipper, you&rsquo;ll find that it&rsquo;s easy to get them from the bottom right flipper via bank shots off the bullseye standup target. &nbsp;You can sometimes backhand TAG letters from the lower left flipper. &nbsp;You can backhand the top lock from the upper flipper.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Target Alpha [EM - Gottlieb, 1976]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Shoot all of the drop targets, then UTAD for the 5000 lane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This game shares the playfield layout with El Dorado / Gold Strike, among others. I list it separately because the scoring is different and alters the strategy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On Target Alpha, the top targets are all worth the same 2000 points, lit or not, and the side ones worth 500. &nbsp;The goal is to get as many of them as possible to maximize your bonus. &nbsp;Bonus is 1000 per target and is doubled on your last ball, making it more important then. &nbsp;Unlike most machines where the playfield light corresponding to a drop target indicates it&rsquo;s now worth more than base value, the lights here only come on to indicate that you&rsquo;ve knocked down that target.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unlike El Dorado, the targets do not reset when completed. &nbsp;Once the targets are down, you&rsquo;re left with just the lanes and the only-100-point bumpers. &nbsp;Focus on that top lane for 5000 if you can and try to drain out the side for 5000 rather than down the center.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key Feeds: &nbsp;watch the three feeds on this machine carefully! &nbsp;When the ball comes down the left lane into the left bumper [feed 1], does it tend to come to the left, meaning either a drain out the left or a feed the left return lane, or come out the right, to either the left flipper or down the center? &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll need to be nudging either way but check its natural tendencies first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When the ball comes down the right side, it can be moving slow if it fell through the left of the two lanes [feed 2] and hits the right wall or rattles unevenly down the right lane, or it can be moving faster if it falls cleanly down the right lane [feed 3]. &nbsp;Again, where does each tend to go? &nbsp;If the clean fall comes out fast enough to reach the left flipper, don&rsquo;t nudge. &nbsp;If the slow fall comes out and thinks about slipping to the right towards the inlane/outlane divider, nudge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The drop targets on the right are rarely backhandable, but you can often do a &ldquo;well-timed-flying-backhand&rdquo; into them when the ball is coming to the right flipper. &nbsp;If it looks like the ball is headed that way in such a manner that you&rsquo;re not likely to be able to trap it on the flipper, give this a try.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Target Pool [EM - Gottlieb, 1969]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Two main goals: &nbsp;collect 14 of the 15 numbers, omitting one of the 1-5 or 9-15, then shoot lit targets (worth 300 vs. 50 unlit); and get the bumper lit for 100 points and hit it as often as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You can&rsquo;t shoot any of the number targets directly, you have to get them via slingshot hits, kicks off of the bumper, or bank shots. &nbsp;Just put the ball up top and let the slings and bumpers do the work, with nudging assist from you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You light the bumper by making the 6, 7 and 8 lanes at the top. &nbsp;Find the Skill Shot for each top lane. &nbsp;Ideally, plunge the 6 first, soft plunge the 8 on the next ball, and get the 7 last to get the sure 100 points when the ball hits the now-lit bumper after going through it. &nbsp;If and only if the game has strong flippers, you can instead plunge for the 7 lane first. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll find that bank shots to the top of the game off of the side standup targets will sometimes go back up through one of the top lanes. &nbsp;This happens far more often for the 6 and 8 lanes than for the 7 lane. &nbsp;If it does go through to the very top, try to nudge the ball into any other lane you don&rsquo;t already have when it comes back down. &nbsp;But it does mean that it&rsquo;s possible to get the bumper lit on the first ball, which is a huge scoring advantage on this game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Collecting numbers &ldquo;sort of&rdquo; increases the number of lit arrow standups, but it&rsquo;s not one-to-one: &nbsp;yes, there are 15 numbers and 15 arrow targets, but how many and which one(s) are lit move with switch hits. &nbsp;You can have two numbers and two lit or ten numbers and none lit, but in general, more numbers translate to more lit targets. &nbsp;Now, why complete all but 1 (!) of the numbers 1-15 around the sides of the game? &nbsp;Because if you get them ALL, the inlanes and outlanes change value from 100 points to Special. &nbsp;In tournament play, the Special is worth Zero. &nbsp;If you do get them all, there&rsquo;s no way to un-do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball control: &nbsp;the inlanes usually will feed the ball down fast enough to transfer it to the other flipper; do so if there are lit arrows you can shoot from the other side but not from the return lane side. &nbsp;Likewise, use dead bounces and catches to get the ball to the shoot-lit side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In general, shoot the ball up top all the time and don&rsquo;t bother to shoot the arrows on the center bank unless they&rsquo;re lit. &nbsp;Going topside gives you a chance to light the bumper if it&rsquo;s not lit, to hit it if it is, and to collect more numbers to light more arrows.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2">Drain shots: &nbsp;The standup targets on the right and left ends of the center bank. &nbsp;The ONLY time you should ever shoot one of these is if all three of these are true:</span></p><p class="c12 c14"><span class="c2">1. &nbsp; it&rsquo;s lit for 300</span></p><p class="c12 c14"><span class="c2">2. &nbsp; you&rsquo;re the final player</span></p><p class="c14 c39"><span class="c2">3. &nbsp;you need less than 300 points to win</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center bank&rsquo;s center target can be drainy, so don&rsquo;t shoot it even if lit. &nbsp;The other center bank targets tend to be fairly safe, but again, don&rsquo;t shoot for one unless it&rsquo;s lit for 300.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Nudging: &nbsp;You want to nudge up top at times to get the ball to hit the upper slings hard enough to get a good kick off of them and score number targets; this calls for a push nudge. &nbsp;You want to do side nudges up top as the ball is approaching the top-bottom divider necks [edges of the slings above and center target bank below] to get the ball to come down from the top along the face of the lower slingshots</span><span class="c5 c9">.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp; The most common drains on the game, besides those two targets I warned you about, are rolling down the sides directly from the upper playfield, slingshot cross-drains on the lower playfield, and soft downward bounces off of the arrow targets near the neck that go down the middle. &nbsp;When you see that the ball is coming down and is either going to hit one of these targets or hit a slingshot too softly to trigger it and then roll into one of the arrow standups, try to gauge the angle of attack. &nbsp;You want the ball to bounce off the arrow target and go parallel to the lower slingshot close enough to it so that the ball rolls down its face to the flipper without triggering the slingshot.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Team One [EM - Gottlieb, 1977]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Get all six numbered lanes, then shoot the lit drop targets all day [soccer ball symbol above target indicates lit status]. &nbsp;Shoot the center stand-up target whenever it&rsquo;s lit [lights by completing either bank of drop targets].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Team One is designed as add-a-ball, but the add-a-balls can be converted to scoring points [usually 50000], and this is how the game is most often set for competition play. &nbsp;The playfield is very similar to Abra ca Dabra, but with a few additions and some different rules.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;whichever number you don&rsquo;t already have. &nbsp;Try for something other than the 4 on ball one, since you can always soft plunge for the 4 later if needed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On a few Team Ones, a plunge into the 1 or 4 lane will occasionally drain down the middle; if yours does that, go for the 2 or 3 instead. &nbsp;The game may also be set so that getting the 2 or the 3 gives you both numbers, which makes it even more desirable to get one of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You want to do two things here: &nbsp;hit each star target when the soccer ball above it is lit and eventually compete all of the 10 targets and try to get the ball to go through all six [vs. four for Abra Ca Dabra] numbered lanes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lanes 1-4 are at the top; lanes 5 and 6 are near the flippers at the bottom. &nbsp;There are also two pad targets, a 5 and a 6, hidden behind the top drop targets on each side. &nbsp;This provides one other way to get the 5 and 6. &nbsp;As on Abra, you can shoot the ball up the 1 and 4 lanes directly [flipper strength permitting], and up the 2 and 3 lanes via bank shots off the rubber behind the drop targets. &nbsp;Numbers carry over from ball to ball, so finish the set a.s.a.p.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For the targets, like Abra, the lit target is worth more, but here, it&rsquo;s a fixed 5000 lit vs. 500 for unlit targets. &nbsp;Switch hits change the lit target, so it will eventually cycle to light each of them in turn. &nbsp;Finishing 1-6 scores 50000 and raises the target values by a factor of 10 to 5000 for unlit targets and 50K for lit ones. &nbsp;If you are close to completing all of the drop targets, go ahead and shoot the remaining few, even if none of the remaining ones are lit, to set up raising their value. &nbsp;Once you finish the drops, in order to reset them, you must either hit the center standup target or get the ball through one of the two outer return lanes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;ve found that on a Team One with decent flippers, I can backhand the upper drop target (or the number behind it, once exposed) from a cradle on the flipper. &nbsp;If that target is a one number you still need, or is lit, go for it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Team One is a good tournament game, rewarding precision drop target shooting.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The Red Max [EM &ndash; Bally, 1971]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;shoot #1 bumper and captive ball to light bumpers on right; next, shoot lit bumpers on right; then shoot saucer at top right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to Flipper: &nbsp;Mild bias Left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill shot: &nbsp;make the single lane at the top left to light all three numbered mushroom bumpers on the right side. &nbsp;Very important!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Red Max is a rare game; only 70 were made, most no longer exist. &nbsp;But it can be a frustrating drain monster and one where the most valuable shot often fails to score (more on that in a moment).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The goal of the game is to collect the 9 letters in T-H-E-R-E-D-M-A-X. &nbsp;This is a two-step process. &nbsp;First, you need to light the mushroom bumpers on the right side of the game. &nbsp;You light all three by getting the ball through the lane at the top left, usually only on the plunge. &nbsp;The mushroom bumper in the center of the game lights bumper #1. &nbsp;Hitting the captive ball all the way back lights &nbsp;#2 and #3; weaker or grazing hits may only light #2.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once you have one or more bumpers lit, hitting a lit one gives you a letter in THEREDMAX, but also turns that bumper off; you need to re-light it to get a chance to add another letter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Your bonus is the value of the letters you&rsquo;ve collected: &nbsp;1000 for THE, 3000 for THERED and 5000 for THEREDMAX. &nbsp;You only collect it at the end of a ball when you drain out a side lane; if you have no letter bonus yet, you get 500 points instead. &nbsp;You can also collect your bonus during a ball by shooting the saucer at the upper right. &nbsp;But &hellip; there is no backstop behind the saucer to ensure that balls shot at it go into it. &nbsp;The ball often zips over the saucer or goes around the edge of it up to the top of the game without scoring it. &nbsp;Your score often depends on how lucky you are at having the ball settle into the saucer. &nbsp;The ball can also drop into the saucer from above, but again it often rims out and goes through without scoring it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s a center ball-save post which is raised by hitting the mushroom bumper right of the captive ball; hitting the bumper left of the captive ball lowers it. &nbsp;If you get the post up, you can use microflips to set up shots.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The pop bumpers are lit in pairs by the two white rollover discs just above them. &nbsp;The rollover on the right lights the green bumpers, the one on the left lights the yellow bumpers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">General strategy is to make the skill shot, raise the center post, then hit the lit bumpers on the right. &nbsp;Once you have some bonus to collect, shoot for the saucer. &nbsp;You can also shoot for the saucer to get the ball up top. &nbsp;If you do get the ball back up top by whatever means, try to nudge it to either light the pop bumpers, go into the left lane to relight the mushroom bumpers, or fall into the saucer from above.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Time Fantasy [SS &ndash; Williams, 1983]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie version: &nbsp;Complete 1-5 to build up playfield multiplier, then complete TIME to start snail time. &nbsp;Continue with shots to 1-5 during snail time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-to Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While it doesn&rsquo;t run on clock time instead of ball count like a few games, &ldquo;TIME&rdquo; is still the key here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill shot: &nbsp;make the flashing top lane among 1-5, which spots you a letter in TIME, ideally the #1 lane (see below); the lit lane cycles left-to-right, then goes from the 5 back to the 1.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The big points here start with spelling T-I-M-E in the recessed left alley. &nbsp;The ball must go all the way up through the metal rails and trigger the stand-up target in the back. &nbsp;The TIME letters, like the top lanes, constantly cycle from top to bottom, then back from the E to the T, making you &ldquo;time&rdquo; your shot precisely to get a letter you need. &nbsp;You can shoot them either forehand or backhand; the forehand has a clearer angle. &nbsp;Transferring the ball from left to right, if you choose, can be done by shatzing or post passing. &nbsp;TIME shots from either flipper can rebound drain down the middle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When you complete TIME, you immediately enter &ldquo;snail time&rdquo; with a minimum of 30 seconds. &nbsp;The ball save is on for the duration; no time is deducted for drained balls, unlike clock-based games. &nbsp;You start with more than 30 seconds if you&rsquo;ve done any of these first: &nbsp;scored a lit return lane (5 seconds each), scored lane #1 at the top (10 seconds) and completed the FANTASY stand-up targets (5 seconds). &nbsp;Starting time quantity goes up to 99 seconds. &nbsp;You cannot earn more time during snail time. &nbsp;While in snail time, completed sets of the top 1-5 lanes increase your playfield multiplier up to a max of 5X (may be completed either before or during snail time). &nbsp;You can continue to shoot TIME letters during snail time to set yourself up for another round of it. &nbsp;There is no limit on how many times snail time can be played during a ball. &nbsp;Time letters are preserved from ball to ball. &nbsp;Playfield multiplier resets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Base bonus is earned from the 1-5 lanes, the Fantasy targets and two per lit return lane, and goes up to 39K. &nbsp;Bonus multiplier is increased by completing the seven Fantasy targets and goes 2X, 3X, 5X then a big 10X. &nbsp;Bonus and multipliers reset each ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Even during normal ball play, completing the 1-5 lanes is valuable: &nbsp;10K the first time, then 30K, 60K, 90K. &nbsp;Put a high playfield multiplier on top of that during snail time and you crush it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I generally do not shoot the horseshoe &ldquo;mushroom jump&rdquo; shot at the lower left except during snail time. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s scoring is interesting. &nbsp;Left orbit shots to the top raise its value from 10K up to as much as 100K, as does scoring the shot in the arrow-lit direction. &nbsp;If you go around the horseshoe in the direction opposite the arrow, its value goes down a notch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For biggest points, first complete your 1-5 lanes several times to get your playfield multiplier high and have more seconds of snail time when you do start it, then keep making the left orbit shot to the top and draining at the bottom to get more plunges to the top lanes. &nbsp;Completing 1-5 during snail time with 5X playfield running is worth 450K.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Time Tunnel [EM - Bally, 1973]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;stop the tunnel on the 5000 value, then shoot the collect tunnel center standup all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This was the original version of Space Time. &nbsp;Just one problem: &nbsp;there was a &ldquo;Time Tunnel&rdquo; TV show I watched in the 1960&rsquo;s, and Bally didn&rsquo;t check first for licensing rights. &nbsp;Oops! &nbsp;Bally had to rename the game. &nbsp;Along the way, they made a few changes before starting production on the revised model.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The primary differences between this and Space Time / Time Zone are the absence of the center post between the flippers and having only one pair of bumpers up top. &nbsp;The tunnel in Time Tunnel was positioned in the center of the playfield between where the lower bumpers are now, rather than underneath the playfield just above the flippers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The skill shot is the collect tunnel lane at the top, but you need to time your plunge so that the tunnel is lit for 5000 when you collect it. &nbsp;The tunnel cycles through values of 1000 to 5000 [look down at the tunnel, you&rsquo;ll see it], stopping when the ball hits the &ldquo;stop tunnel&rdquo; switch near the top of the plunger lane. &nbsp;You can try to soft plunge just up to the stop switch first, then go for the collect plunge after that, but I&rsquo;ve found it&rsquo;s harder to accurately time a soft plunge than the near-full plunge that gets the center collect lane. &nbsp;If you do the one-step near-full plunge, line up the plunger on the right spot on the plunge markers first, then time your release while watching the tunnel lights cycling below.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once the ball is in play, your goal is simple: &nbsp;shoot the center red standup target all day to collect tunnel value so long as the value is 3000 or more. &nbsp;If the tunnel is on 1000 or 2000, you&rsquo;re usually better off shooting the ball towards the gate, if open, the collect bonus on the left [which shoots the ball back up top], or just shooting the ball up top towards the &ldquo;start tunnel&rdquo; saucers to change it. &nbsp;If your plunge fell into one of the start tunnel saucers, or the ball got there after rattling around in the bumpers, the tunnel value will stop again when you hit that center target, or when the ball goes into the &ldquo;collect tunnel&rdquo; pocket on the left side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The lack of a center post dramatically changes how the game plays. &nbsp;Whereas on Space Time you want to raise the post, get the ball to settle between it and a flipper, and repeatedly shoot the center collect tunnel standup target, that&rsquo;s not possible here. &nbsp;For one thing, shooting that center collect standup with no center post means a high risk of a center drain! &nbsp;The machine is now more of a flow game where the strategy is UTAD. &nbsp;Your safest chance of collecting the tunnel is now through random bounces into either the top saucer or either side chute.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The two gates are more useful here than on Space Time, too, since they score both points and collect tunnel; shoot or nudge the ball through them whenever you can. &nbsp;Each of the two top saucers opens one of the gates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While you can use the two &ldquo;start tunnel&rdquo; standup targets to the side of the center collect target to change the tunnel value, the rebounds off of those targets can be really risky, so I&rsquo;d avoid them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When you compare Time Tunnel with Space Time / Time Zone, you find that the addition of the center post makes the game much more skill-based. &nbsp;In this case, Bally&rsquo;s error was a fortunate thing since it led to the creation of a better game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you run across a Time Tunnel machine, please let me know where it is!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Time Warp [SS - Williams, 1979]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Right side chute whenever you can, drop targets when you can&rsquo;t. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a rare anti-UTAD game, i.e. don&rsquo;t bother going up the center to the top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ah, &ldquo;Banana Flippers.&rdquo;

target at the top end of the chute on the right starts off worth 10K and a bonus advance; finish the target 5-bank or get the top saucer award and it changes to 30K and 3 advances. &nbsp;Shooting the bullseye also feeds the right saucer, scoring your bonus which is not reset. &nbsp;The kickout from the collect saucer goes into the bumper area; once in a while, it will go into the collect chute from the bumper side, too. &nbsp;You might get more than one bonus collect from a single bullseye shot. &nbsp;Make the bullseye a lot!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing the drop target 5-bank on the right advances your bonus multiplier. &nbsp;It goes 2X, 3X, 5X, 10X; I think this was the first game with a 10X bonus multiplier. &nbsp;That last multiplier advance is huge. &nbsp;If you have 5X already with the ball on the left flipper, making the 5-bank for 10X can be more valuable than shooting the bullseye. &nbsp;The 5-bank also lights an outlane for 30K the first [left] and second [right] times you finish it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The drop target 3-bank on the left scores progressive values when finished: &nbsp;5K, 10K, 15K, 20K, 30K. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not worth special effort to go for it, but do shoot it if the ball is on the right flipper; target shots to either bank tend to rebound into the other set of drops, so you often get one [or more] targets in each bank per shot. &nbsp;Shooting at the 3-bank usually helps you complete the more important 5-bank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The A-B-C lanes merely give bonus advances and progress you towards a Special, so ignore them.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Time Zone [EM - Bally, 1973]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Stop the tunnel on the 5000 value, then shoot the collect tunnel center standup all day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the 2-player version of Space Time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot is the collect tunnel lane at the top, but you need to time your plunge so that the tunnel is lit for 5000 when you collect it. &nbsp;The tunnel cycles through values of 1000 to 5000 [look down at the tunnel, you&rsquo;ll see it], stopping when the ball hits the &ldquo;stop tunnel&rdquo; switch near the top of the plunger lane. &nbsp;You can try to soft plunge just up to the stop switch first, then go for the collect plunge after that, but I&rsquo;ve found it&rsquo;s harder to accurately time a soft plunge than the near-full plunge that gets the center collect lane. &nbsp;If you do the one-step near-full plunge, line up the plunger on the right spot on the plunge markers first, then time your release while watching the tunnel lights cycling below.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once the ball is in play, your goal is simple: &nbsp;shoot the center red standup target all day to collect tunnel value so long as the value is 3000 or more. &nbsp;If the tunnel is on 1000 or 2000, you&rsquo;re usually better off shooting the ball towards the gate, if open, the collect bonus on the left [which shoots the ball back up top], or just shooting the ball up top towards the &ldquo;start tunnel&rdquo; saucers to change it. &nbsp;If your plunge fell into one of the start tunnel saucers, or the ball got there after rattling around in the bumpers, the tunnel value will stop again when you hit that center target, or when the ball goes into the &ldquo;collect tunnel&rdquo; pocket on the left side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball control and soft flips are the keys here. &nbsp;Once you&rsquo;ve hit the center target, which raises the center post, you want the ball to settle back down onto a flipper to repeat. &nbsp;The easiest way is to use dead bounces or drop catches to get the ball to settle into the hollow between the tip of a flipper and the center post. &nbsp;Once it&rsquo;s there, use very light flipper taps to try to hop the ball across to the other flipper just high enough to let you cradle it, but not so hard that it goes up and away or triggers a slingshot. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s delicate and requires patience. &nbsp;Breathe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are two &ldquo;down post&rdquo; white buttons near the tops of the slingshots. &nbsp;You want to avoid them. &nbsp;Also, don&rsquo;t be caught off guard if the ball triggers one of them; be ready to flip or try for a trap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While you can use the two &ldquo;start tunnel&rdquo;

they&rsquo;re not normal standups, they&rsquo;re flipper buttons! &nbsp;This is the only game I know of with that. &nbsp;Second quirk is their scoring. &nbsp;Targets are 100 unlit, 500 lit; #1 starts lit, the others not. &nbsp;Hit #1 and the light moves right to #2; now both #1 and #2 score 500. &nbsp;Hit #2 and the light moves to #3, etc. on to #8. &nbsp;You can also advance the light by scoring the little rollover button in the middle below #s 4 and 5 (the button itself doesn&rsquo;t score any points), and the top saucer when lit spots 2 numbers. &nbsp;Once you finish all 8 numbers, the targets change value to 1000 plus add bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The playfield layout is similar to Air Aces. &nbsp;As on that game, avoid the temptation to shoot the center targets, especially from the upper flippers. &nbsp;That gets the ball going sideways too much and risks draining. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a bit of a shame that the centerpiece of the game is not worth the risk to shoot at.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy is just up top to build bonus, then A and B to double it, then up top again for the 5K saucer. &nbsp;Everything resets each ball.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Top Card [EM &ndash;

they only score 500 in 5-ball play (may be 1000 in 3-ball play). &nbsp;Where they help on points is in increasing the value of the bumpers. &nbsp;Strategy is to hit targets to light the bumpers: &nbsp;get the Ace to light the bottom bumper; get the five #9-K targets on the right to light the right bumper; get the five #2-6 targets on the left to light the left bumper. &nbsp;Once you have the bumpers lit, just keep flipping the ball up top and nudging to get as much bumper action as you can before the ball comes back down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This was one of the first games to use the indented-angle-with-post return lanes. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll need to learn when to nudge and when not to nudge to get balls to enter the return lane vs. drain when they go into either lower side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Competitive item: &nbsp;when you start the game, the rollover value is that left at the end of the previous game. &nbsp;This is an advantage for any player who inherits a 1000 value vs. a 10 value. &nbsp;Since it&rsquo;s a single player machine, if it&rsquo;s at the 1000 value before your match starts, you may want to choose to play first.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Top Score [EM &ndash;

This game has a rare &ldquo;ball count&rdquo; bonus display feature, inside the backglass. &nbsp;Your bonus is one thousand per ball shown in the window. &nbsp;You want to get the bonus up close to its maximum of 10K, collect it, and repeat that process. &nbsp;The collect part is important since you can&rsquo;t advance the bonus beyond 10K - bonus advance shots don&rsquo;t add any bonus at that point. &nbsp;If your bonus is at 10K, collecting it is your absolute priority.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Primary feature: &nbsp;the two saucers at the upper left. &nbsp;The left saucer collects and resets your bonus, plus giving you 1000 points. &nbsp;The right saucer randomly adds 1K, 2K or 3K to your bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is built many ways. &nbsp;The center spinner advances bonus 1K per five spins. &nbsp;The return lanes, outlanes, upper left lane and standup targets all advance it 1K when lit. &nbsp; The right side of the game is a set of eight lanes in four side-by-side pairs. &nbsp;These are lit crosswise, i.e. either (top-left) + (second-right) + (third-left) + (bottom-right) or vice versa. &nbsp;If you shoot the ball into these, you&rsquo;ll want to keep it in the lit lanes to add bonus, so nudge accordingly. &nbsp;The bottom right lane drops to a gap between the right return lane and a rubbered post and will drain if not nudged properly, unless the gate is open.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The upper left lane, below the saucers, opens that gate at the right outlane; you want that gate open whenever possible. &nbsp;The lane can&rsquo;t be reliably shot directly, but you can nudge the ball in when it&rsquo;s bouncing off the left bumper. &nbsp;If the ball is in the vicinity, try to do so!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;I like to go for the left of the two top lanes; the ball will fall onto the right pop bumper from there, and I try to nudge the bounce off the bumper into the upper [right] add-bonus saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Right flipper: &nbsp;shoot for the saucers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Left flipper: &nbsp;shoot the spinner to advance bonus and get the ball rattling in the bumpers where it might bounce into a saucer or over to the left to open the gate. &nbsp;You can also consider shooting for the eight right side lanes, but I suggest doing so only when the crosswise sequence has the top right lane lit. &nbsp;The ball usually goes in there when you shoot it up that way, so you&rsquo;ll likely get at least one advance, up to four if the ball falls through the sequence of lanes optimally. &nbsp;This sequence has the right return lane lit, too, which is where you want the ball to go if it falls through all four levels of lanes rather than bouncing out into the center of the playfield. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball Control: &nbsp;do NOT hold the right flipper up to roll the ball up to a cradle: &nbsp;it will often go up and out the gap at the right side of the wire form. &nbsp;Live catches and drop catches are fine but use caution so you don&rsquo;t accidentally do the roll-out.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Torch [SS &ndash;

and right as &ldquo;C&rdquo;. &nbsp;The symbols on every target are a 1, 2 or 3. &nbsp;The tic-tac-toe grid at the center of the playfield tells you how your multipliers work. &nbsp;Hitting the same target number in all three positions gives you 3X; hitting all three different numbers in the same position gives you 4X; getting a diagonal pattern, e.g. A1, B2 and C3, gets you 2X; getting all four corners, i.e. A1, A3, C1 and C3 gives you 5X; finally, completing the entire grid of nine gives you 10X bonus. &nbsp;The game spots you the B2 position to start.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To get different roto targets, you need to spin it by scoring any of the 6 lanes, top right gate or the standup bullseye target below that gate. &nbsp;Each outlane also spots a roto target &ndash; the left outlane gives the current A number, the right outlane the current C number.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You also get specific roto targets for completing either drop target bank. &nbsp;Get the left 5-bank and receive A1 and C3; get the right bank for A3 and C1. &nbsp;Completing both banks thus gets you 4X even with no roto target hits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Base bonus goes up to 20K, built by hitting the drop targets, lanes and the bullseye target. &nbsp;Base bonus, multiplier and grid positions scored reset each ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You can collect your bonus when at 10X and 20K by shooting the upper right gate. &nbsp;Base bonus then resets, your 10X stays for the remainder of the ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The top lanes score 5K the first time (when lit); getting both of either side&rsquo;s pair lights the drop target bank on the same side for extra points for target hits. &nbsp;Targets start at 1k, but you get 1K extra per lit number after turning the light on, so with a full roto grid of nine, they&rsquo;re worth 10K each.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Put all this together and you need to shoot the roto several times, with shots through a lane to spin it in between, to fill up your bonus multiplier. &nbsp;My preference is through the gate to the top lanes. &nbsp;Once you get the grid nearly full, shoot the drop targets all day for bonus base and target points until you can do your 10X-20K collect gate shot. &nbsp;If you get that far, just keep shooting targets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The game has post-bounce return lanes; balls must be moving at the right speed to deflect into the return lanes rather than falling into the lower outlane. &nbsp;Watch out for up-and-out drains if the ball rolls up too far on either flipper. &nbsp;Transfers other than tap passes are not advised.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Totem [SS &ndash;

the bottom return lanes and outlanes give additional advances. &nbsp;Bonus multiplier goes up to 5X and is advanced four ways. &nbsp;First is by completing the two B or two C drop targets along with the corresponding top lane. &nbsp;Second is completing all six drop targets, which also scores 5000. &nbsp;Third is hitting the top left vari-target all the way back, which also scores 5K. &nbsp;Fourth is by draining out either side, again also worth 5K. &nbsp;The drop targets don&rsquo;t reset until you complete all six.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Total bonus therefore goes up to 100K. &nbsp;Bonus can be collected during the ball in play at the saucer on the right once the base bonus is maxed at 20K. &nbsp;You should wait to collect until you have made good progress with your multiplier, but once that&rsquo;s at 5X, you should make collecting bonus your top priority. &nbsp;After collecting, bonus resets to be filled again but the multiplier is preserved for the remainder of that ball. &nbsp;Both base bonus and multiplier reset each ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While the drops score points and increase your multiplier, the safest play is just up top from the left flipper and top left vari-target from the right flipper. &nbsp;This avoids risky rebounds off the drops; don&rsquo;t bother shooting them unless you need only one more to advance your multiplier, and even then take the vari-target instead if you have the ball on the right flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On three-ball play, the A and D lanes at the top are connected; making either scores both. &nbsp;Set for five balls, they&rsquo;re independent, as the B and C always are.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feeds: &nbsp;balls coming down from the top over the rollovers on the right and the rebound from the vari-target channel. &nbsp;Note the rubber below the vari-target sticks out so that the ball bounces off it on the way down rather than rolling smoothly to the left flipper. &nbsp;Balls coming down the right side can and often do come cleanly to the right flipper for a cradle. &nbsp;Balls coming down through the gaps between the two B and the two C targets may need to be nudged as they exit the top of the playfield to avoid center drains.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If the ball is banging around on the right bumper, try to get it to go through the gate to the right. &nbsp;Besides scoring 5K, this allows the ball to come to the bottom via the usually-safer right arc than the more dangerous gaps between the drops.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">While extra balls should be off, if on, getting all four A-B-C-D lanes lights the extra ball target just below and right of the D lane.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Travel Time [EM - Williams, 1973]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Make the Skill Shot [center lane] &hellip;

game. &nbsp;My best score on this is a bit over 11 million - - yes, rolling it 110 times in one game [I played it literally all day - - not the same quarter, the same game - - and only stopped when the arcade closed for the night.] &nbsp;But it can also be almost unplayably bad. &nbsp;Read on and be amazed, disgusted or both.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Skill Shot is to make the center lane to add 10 time units. &nbsp;This is THE MOST IMPORTANT thing about the entire game. &nbsp;Learn this or lose miserably.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The game runs on time, not balls. &nbsp;You start with 1:30 on the clock; the clock starts running as soon as the ball goes through one of the top three lanes. &nbsp;You can stop the clock by shooting the ball into the center saucer; this is your single most important shot on the game. &nbsp;The clock is restarted by either of the red rollover buttons to the sides of the center saucer area and by the upkicker between the flippers. &nbsp;The clock also stops when the ball drains out either side, but if the ball drains out the middle, e.g. between the flippers and the upkicker, the clock doesn&rsquo;t stop until the ball is in the bottom trough, so try to not to drain down the middle. &nbsp;If you see that a center drain is unavoidable, in some cases you can slap the ball backwards with a flip-and-release to get it to drain quicker!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Besides the top center lane, time is added to the clock when you complete the set of six top T-R-A-V-E-L standup targets or the four mid-playfield T-I-M-E targets and then get the ball to drop into the upkicker. &nbsp;Each is good for 25 time units. &nbsp;The clock maxes out at 2:55, so if you&rsquo;re close to that and have the upkicker lit, shoot more letters before using it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Basic strategy: &nbsp;make the Skill Shot every time you plunge. &nbsp;During play, shoot for the letters to finish them, then let the ball roll down off a flipper into the upkicker to cash in and add time. &nbsp;In most cases, the upkicker will then throw the ball into the stop clock saucer, which then kicks the ball out towards the right flipper. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve just added 25 seconds and stopped the clock; shoot for more letters, i.e. rinse and repeat. &nbsp;When you go up top, try to go around the start clock buttons, of course. &nbsp;You can also get the ball up top with a too-hard shot to the center saucer that can go through into the bumpers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key things on this game are the kickouts, especially how often the upkicker successfully plops the ball into the stop clock saucer. &nbsp;If that percentage isn&rsquo;t high, games will be short since direct stop-clock shots are both difficult and often go through as mentioned. &nbsp;Also, the machine&rsquo;s pitch is critical: &nbsp;if the game is too shallow or floaty, the ball will take too long to do things while the clock is running, and you won&rsquo;t be able to earn time faster than it&rsquo;s used up. &nbsp;In this case, a viable strategy is to just Skill Shot and drain all day, i.e. let the ball go out as quickly as you can and hope it averages less than 10 time units before doing so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Points, oh, yes, points. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s all about the saucers and top lanes. &nbsp;The stop clock one is worth 5000 when lit, and the upkicker, when you have a set of letters completed, is also 5000, otherwise the upkicker is 500. &nbsp;Top lanes are 2000 for the center and 1000 for each side. &nbsp;The rollover buttons, targets, slings and bumpers don&rsquo;t add much unless you have very active bumpers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ball control is key - - managing the clock means not cradling the ball when the clock is running. &nbsp;Flailing just wastes time you haven&rsquo;t got to spare. &nbsp;Do one of three things: &nbsp;take controlled, well-aimed shots;

it cycles from left to right, each blinking for five seconds or so before moving on. &nbsp;If the standup target there is still up, knocking it down when the light is flashing awards 10000. &nbsp;Unlit targets score 1000 when hit. &nbsp;Shooting these is the single fastest way to score on this game. &nbsp;Since the targets are all in the lowest part of the playfield, though, there&rsquo;s drain risk when shooting any of them, so watch those rebounds! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s possible to get more than one target on a shot if the rebound goes the right way for you; grazing shots are best for this. &nbsp;You can backhand some of the targets, too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Each time you complete the Z-O-N-E letters, lit or not, other scoring is increased: &nbsp;the first set lights the left spinner; the second set changes the top saucer value from 5000 to 10000; the third set makes all four Zone letters worth 10000 each for the rest of the ball [the lights come on for all of them at once, steady rather than flashing]; the fourth set lights the outlanes for a special [irrelevant], but at that point, the 10K per target alone makes them your primary goal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Your other source of decent points is bonus. &nbsp;Bonus base goes up to 19K and is advanced by the T-R-I lanes and both sets of A-B lanes, those on top and the two return lanes. &nbsp;Bonus multiplier goes up to 5X and is advanced by completing the A-B lanes in either location.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Making T-R-I scores 3K the first time, 5K the second and 10K the third. &nbsp;After that, it&rsquo;s and EB or Special, likely worthless. &nbsp;[I don&rsquo;t recall ever seeing a Tri Zone set so that these award points; I&rsquo;d like to.]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The top saucer is worth 5K at all times, but you can&rsquo;t shoot at it, only nudge the ball towards it, so it&rsquo;s largely irrelevant.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Trident [SS &ndash;

get those for 2X. &nbsp;The targets reset and now #&rsquo;s 1, 3 and 5 are up; get them for 3X; next 1-2-4-5 give you 4X; finally, shoot all five to get 5X.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The spinner values are increased by the standup targets at the top right. &nbsp;Each is color-coded: &nbsp;the top white target and center orange target add 400 per spin to the left spinner. &nbsp;The green and yellow targets add 400 per spin to the right spinner. &nbsp;The bottom pink target adds 1000 to one of the two spinners; which one alternates with 10-point switches. &nbsp;When all five standups have been hit, the spinner with the 1K light on will be worth 2000 per spin and the other 1000 per spin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The right outlane has a post-return below it; balls falling at the proper speed and alignment will bounce off it and up onto the return lane above the right flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Top saucer value goes up one step for each drop target bank completed: &nbsp;5K, 10K, 20K, 30K. &nbsp;The left return lane value goes up one step for each left rollover button hit: &nbsp;2K, 4K, 6K, 8K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy is to concentrate on the two target banks at first to build up your spinner values and both base bonus and bonus multiplier. &nbsp;Once those are at high values, abandon the targets and shoot spinners exclusively. &nbsp;Give preference to the spinner which currently has the 1K add-on light lit. &nbsp;Transfer the ball to whichever flipper has the shot for that spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Flow Style Alert! &nbsp;Watch out for losing the ball up and out the right side if you try to trap for a cradle with the ball coming too fast to the right flipper or by using a dead bounce to it off the left flipper. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll also find that ripping the spinner on the fly as the ball comes down the left chute gives more spins than a cradled shot, so use the ball&rsquo;s motion to your advantage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s normally a center post between the flippers;

rollovers as possible before having the ball drop into the lit advance spinner lane. &nbsp;The lit lane changes as the ball hits the side rubbers at the top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After that, go up top until your base bonus is maxed out at 10,000. &nbsp;Once the base bonus is maxed, if you&rsquo;re close to completing the center spinner to increase the bonus multiplier, go up top again and try to get the lit lane to finish it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The fastest way to increase your bonus multiplier is to shoot the spinner. &nbsp;If the spinner is not too lively, though, ignore it and stick with UTAD for the lit lane. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d say to ignore the spinner completely, except that UTAD will eventually drain when the ball comes out of the top bumpers the wrong way towards those gaping no-return-lane sides or straight down the middle, so since one good whack to the spinner can be worth several top shots as far as advancing the spinner goes, it can be less risky statistically to take one spinner shot than those several top shots. &nbsp;The spinner shot is best done when the spinner posts are near the 3 o&rsquo;clock and 9 o&rsquo;clock positions to maximize the number of spins a hit to it gets you. &nbsp;Also, try to hit the outside edges of the posts: &nbsp;you want the rebound to go sideways and up rather than down towards an outlane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ignore the A-B-C-D completely. &nbsp;I much prefer the add-a-ball version of this game [Star Action], since it brings the A-B-C-D into play - - completing them twice scores an extra ball in that version.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once your bonus is at 30,000, if the spinner is lit for 100 points per spin, spinner all day until you drain. &nbsp;Otherwise UTAD until you drain.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Triple Strike [EM - Williams, 1975]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Similar in layout to Triple Action / Star Action, except that here, there&rsquo;s only an orbit to the top on the left; the right side is closed off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The A-B-C-D oversized drop targets [again like Star Action or Big Ben] are one key; completing them increases the value of the return lanes and the three left orbit rollover buttons from 100 to 1000, and the top saucer from 500 to 5000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This bowling-themed game uses 10 button rollovers for your ten pins. &nbsp;The buttons advance your bonus to a maximum of 39,000. &nbsp;You can hold your bonus as well: &nbsp;if you collect the top saucer three times during a ball, it activates hold bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I prefer the UTAD strategy on this game, especially until you have your hold bonus activated. &nbsp;While you can shoot for the A-B-C-D targets, you&rsquo;ll probably get the A and B eventually via bounces off the bumper from balls coming down from the top of the game, and you may get C and D from ball-saving shots with the flippers. &nbsp;Likewise, shooting the ten rollovers is largely unnecessary since balls falling from above will go over them. &nbsp;I tend to only shoot at rollovers or letters when I just need one or two to finish the set.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The huge side outlanes on this game; while there&rsquo;s plenty of room for the ball to bounce off the side walls into a return lane, those walls may be pretty dead wood now, 40+ years after the game was made. &nbsp;If your walls are dead, you&rsquo;ll have to bump the game to have a chance to save balls heading out the side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One other thing you can try on this game is shatzing the wide return lanes; with strong enough flippers, you&rsquo;ll score the return lane and the ball will continue up into the C or D drop target. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s fun to do, but only worth the risk if the rebound off the C or D proves to be safe.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Tropic Fun [EM - Williams, 1973]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;shoot the center target to get three numbers in a row and shoot to collect of the all lettered lanes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the add-a-ball version of Gulf Stream. &nbsp;The scores are ten times higher. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m assuming herein that extra balls and specials are set to award points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I played this game a lot in college, and it was fun, but largely because it was set for extra balls. &nbsp;Since I was in a snowy climate, the tropic part [backglass scene] was welcome, too. &nbsp;There are two themes to this game, completing the lettered lanes and the center target. &nbsp;The center target scores one of the 1-9 targets, whichever is lit on the playfield below it at the time. &nbsp;Hundred point switches change the lit number.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The key here is to get either three number in a row or all four corner numbers. Three in a row lights the center target and the two side saucers for 50,000; Get all four corners and it&rsquo;s worth 100,000. &nbsp;Finishing the S-P-E-C-I-A-L letters lights the return lanes for 50,000. These are the only big points available on the game; the rest of the time, these are 5000, as are the lanes at all times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Since this machine was really designed for EBs and free games, it&rsquo;s rarely used in tournaments.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Artwork note: &nbsp;while human figures in pinball art are not always properly scaled, the ones on the playfield here are exceptionally bad: &nbsp;the arms and legs are way too long compared to the rest of the bodies. &nbsp;Watch out for those sharp knees!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Valencia [EM &ndash;

they&rsquo;re not normal standups, they&rsquo;re flipper buttons! &nbsp;This is the only game I know of with that. &nbsp;Second quirk is their scoring. &nbsp;Targets are 100 unlit, 500 lit; #1 starts lit, the others not. &nbsp;Hit #1 and the light moves right to #2; now both #1 and #2 score 500. &nbsp;Hit #2 and the light moves to #3, etc. on to #8. &nbsp;You can also advance the light by scoring the little rollover button in the middle below #s 4 and 5 (the button itself doesn&rsquo;t score any points), and the top saucer when lit spots 2 numbers. &nbsp;Once you finish all 8 numbers, the targets change value to 1000 plus add bonus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The playfield layout is similar to Air Aces. &nbsp;As on that game, avoid the temptation to shoot the center targets, especially from the upper flippers. &nbsp;That gets the ball going sideways too much and risks draining. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a bit of a shame that the centerpiece of the game is not worth the risk to shoot at.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy is just up top to build bonus, then A and B to double it, then up top again for the 5K saucer. &nbsp;Everything resets each ball.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Viking [SS - Bally, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Shoot the left inline drop targets; once they&rsquo;re done, shoot the standup target behind them from the right and the right orbit to the upper left saucer from the left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right until you finish the inline drop targets, then Left to shoot the right orbit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;center saucer, but not a big deal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are two basic strategies on Viking, but they share one thing in common: &nbsp;getting all of the left side inline targets at some point. &nbsp;These drop targets increase your bonus multiplier up to 5X [and add base bonus]. &nbsp;The standup target behind them is a special, usually set to award 50K per shot, which stays active for the remainder of the ball once the drop targets are down. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s one way to go to town on this game. &nbsp;Oh, yes, getting all of the drops also lights the Extra Ball rollover, and lights the outlanes for 25K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The other way is through bonus collection during the ball. &nbsp;The top left saucer is lit for collect bonus by making the right orbit. &nbsp;A strong shot to the right orbit will continue across the game above the bumpers directly into the collect bonus saucer. &nbsp;You can also get the ball in the saucer by shooting it in the vicinity of the left bumper and having that kick it in. &nbsp;Collects can be huge; your base bonus goes up to 59K, so with 5X, that becomes a 295,000 shot! &nbsp;This is the other high-score strategy, and the one most likely to lead to top qualifying scores. &nbsp;When you collect bonus, you need to shoot the right orbit again to relight the collect saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Balls going into the upper left saucer when lit for collect bonus will be ejected out into the top of the game towards the a / B / center saucer as a plunged ball would be. &nbsp;Balls going into the left saucer when not lit to collect are ejected back towards the left bumper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The spinner is has a unique feature. &nbsp;Besides every tenth spin adding a bonus [normal] it also increases the spinner value [unique]. &nbsp;But the increase is on a timer; if you go too long between spinner shots, the value drops back down. &nbsp;The first good rip will increase it from 10 points to 100; the next one, if soon enough, raises it to its maximum value of 1000 per spin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One reason some players start by shooting the spinner is to increase bonus and get some quick points on the board, assuming the spinner is active enough. &nbsp;You should get a couple of advances per shot, plus whatever you get up top when the ball comes down through the A or B lane or the center saucer, plus 20K-30K per shot once you have the spinner up to 1K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Viking is one of the Bally games with Super Bonus, where certain amounts are held when reached. &nbsp;On Viking, getting to 20K base bonus preserves that amount for all future balls; getting to 40K is the other level that is held. &nbsp;Both are clearly valuable, since they mean less need to take bonus-building shots on future balls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The drop target three-bank at the upper right is generally worth ignoring. &nbsp;The value of completing them starts at 2000 and rises 2000 per set up to 10K. &nbsp;But the value increases by a factor of ten if you get the targets in 1-2-3 sequence, so that&rsquo;s 20K to start and 100K maximum. &nbsp;The trouble is, they&rsquo;re riskier to shoot at than the left drops / standup or the right orbit.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Volley [EM - Gottlieb, 1976]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Up top until you have all three colors lit, then drop targets all day. &nbsp;When you have to shoot targets before all three colors are lit, shoot for targets of colors you have so far.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is a &ldquo;targets worth more based on lit lanes&rdquo; game, so focus on lighting lanes first. &nbsp;Try to make one on the Skill Shot plunge; it&rsquo;s best to get one of the two side lanes first [blue or green], since you&rsquo;re more likely to get hits on those colored targets below first. &nbsp;Each colored lane lights the matching colored targets and bumper. &nbsp;When the ball comes down, shoot it back up top; if you&rsquo;re lucky or good, you&rsquo;ll get the ball back above the top lanes where you can try to nudge it into one you still need. &nbsp;If not, try to use the bumpers to nudge the ball up top either around the edges or going upwards through one of the top lanes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once you have all 3 lanes lit, it&rsquo;s time to go for the drop targets. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re worth 500 unlit, 5000 lit. &nbsp;Getting all three lanes also lights the top center lane for 5000. &nbsp;But shooting the targets isn&rsquo;t as simple as it sounds. &nbsp;Yes, you get 5000 for hitting a lit target, but this game registers target hits slowly. &nbsp;If you hit two at once, it will only register as one. &nbsp;If you hit one or two blue or green targets and the ball then rebounds into one or two yellow targets, you&rsquo;ll probably still get only one 5000 hit registered! &nbsp;You&rsquo;re often better off shooting the yellow targets first, trying to pick them off one at a time, then doing the greens and the blues one by one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The targets do not reset until you complete all three banks. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re getting close to doing this, don&rsquo;t worry about hitting more than one at a time, finish them off so that you have 15 fresh targets to shoot at.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Watch out when you miss a target or otherwise hit the rubber behind the target banks; those rebounds can be dangerous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The most challenging [and stressful!] part of this game is dealing with balls coming down the upper half of the sides, i.e. behind the blue and green target banks. &nbsp;You clearly want the ball to drop into the return lane rather than the outlane but guessing and timing the nudging or not on this is a true art form not easily mastered. &nbsp;Avoid any shots that would have the balls go in there as best you can [e.g. don&rsquo;t hit the outside edges of the end yellow targets] and be alert and ready to nudge when the ball is coming down from the top of the playfield. &nbsp;The one caveat I would make here is if the ball looks like it will either go in the side lane or rattle off the top of the target bank divider towards the center, remember that even side lane plus outlane is better than straight down the middle.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Voltan [SS - Bally, 1979]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;shatz the #7 and #3 return lanes if possible, then UTAD through the spinners;

1 through 9: &nbsp;the four top lanes, lower three stand-up targets and the two return lanes. &nbsp;End of ball bonus is 2K per planet. &nbsp;If you finish the planets, it holds 18K the first time as your &ldquo;Jumbo&rdquo; bonus and 36K the second time as your &ldquo;Super&rdquo; bonus, letting you get up to three sets of planets. &nbsp;Bonus multiplier is either 1X or 3X, rather unusual. &nbsp;Get 3X by completing A-B-C-D; A and B are the upper standup targets, C is either #4 top lane or #7 in the left return lane, D is either the #6 top lane or #3 in the right return lane. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The return lanes, #7 and #3, are the catch. &nbsp;You need to either be lucky or able to shatz them in order to get more than 42K in bonus. &nbsp;(42K is 14K for 7 planets #&rsquo;s 1,2,4,5,6,8,9 times 3X for ABCD.) &nbsp;But if you finish the planets three times and have 3X, your bonus is 162K. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s a huge difference, and largely luck-driven due to the return lanes. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not a fan of this as a competition game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Getting the 1-3-7-9 planets light the two outlanes for 50K, making the machine&rsquo;s luck-boxness even worse. &nbsp;If you get the return lanes on ball one, you can get up to 150K from outlane drains. &nbsp;If you never get them, you get 3K for three outlane drains. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Finishing the four top lanes 1-4-6-9 raises their value to 5K each thereafter. &nbsp;Getting A and B lights the spinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy, such as it is, is UTAD through the spinners, lit or not, and only shoot at the #2, #5 or #8 targets when they&rsquo;re all you need to complete a set of planets. &nbsp;Shatz #3 and #7 if you can, but if you&rsquo;re not good at shatzing, stick with UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bottom line if you have to play it is pray you can shatz the two return lanes, otherwise you&rsquo;ll likely have to be luckier than your opponents to win.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Vulcan [EM - Gottlieb, 1977]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Up top via the left orbit until you have at least three numbers;

you get up to 7K for each of the three numbered sets. &nbsp;Once you complete a target bank, the gate on the right lights to collect bonus, which does not reset for the rest of the ball. &nbsp;You do have to re-complete a numbered bank to recollect it&rsquo;s bonus through the gate, though. &nbsp;Have all three sets done and you can collect all three bonuses with your multiplier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing the top X-Y-Z lanes is your bonus multiplier advance up to 5X for maximum of 105K. &nbsp;With the gate active, there&rsquo;s no limit to how many times you can collect bonus. &nbsp;Bonus and multipliers reset each ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The return lanes and the upper left stand-up target are each worth 7K and also spot a #3 target from the top bank. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s pretty easy to get a ball approaching a flipper to deflect up a return lane to score it. &nbsp;Balls also zip fast down the return lanes and transfer easily to the opposite flipper.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Wild Card [EM &ndash;

when you&rsquo;re on one of these magic numbers, switch goals to shoot the spinner while the higher value lasts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Wild Fyre has a sometimes-cruel drain feature on your final ball. &nbsp;Once you have your double bonus, the game toggles back and forth between 2X and 5X on switch hits. &nbsp;This can actually provide an incentive to deliberately drain! &nbsp;If you have enough bonus to win with 5X but not enough to win at 2X and have the 5X on at the moment, draining is better than playing on - - provided you can drain without hitting a switch to toggle it back to 2X first. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s possible for you to outplay your opponent but lose because they drain with 5X lit while you drain with only 2X.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Top saucers are 3K each, but after you get all three on one ball, the center one becomes worth 7K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ignore the WILDFYRE targets, which merely light Special when completed;

lane. &nbsp;A ball in the top saucer will be ejected into this lane; you can also get the ball there with shots to the top that rattle around or hit the bumper and go in. &nbsp;The lane flags do the following when tripped by the ball rolling through the upper right lane:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2">Flag 1 &ndash;

might as well light it. &nbsp;The left star rollover, which lights the bumpers, is not as good, but still better than getting neither rollover. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">On any shot to the top, your priority is to nudge the ball into the saucer for 3000 + 3 bonus advances + 400 points when it is kicked out over the four flag rollovers + whatever features your flags activate. &nbsp;Getting one of those star rollovers at the top is nice if you&rsquo;re missing that flag, but don&rsquo;t let that make you miss the saucer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feed: &nbsp;Flag exit. &nbsp;Ball control is king here. &nbsp;When the ball comes down the flags lane, you want to get it back to the right flipper by whatever means works best. &nbsp;This could be letting it dead bounce off the left flipper to the right, drop catching on the left, then tap passing or alley passing to the right, live catching on the right, or some variation of these. &nbsp;It all depends on how fast the ball comes down the chute and where it goes when it does. &nbsp;Nudge as needed if it doesn&rsquo;t come cleanly to one of these options.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you have a strong enough left flipper, you may be able to backhand the spinner. &nbsp;If so, consider yourself lucky - - you can now make your priority shot from either flipper without risking a transfer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you have your base bonus close to maximum (19000) and have not yet doubled it, it&rsquo;s probably worthwhile to risk shooting at the Flag 2 standup target at the lower left to activate that flag. &nbsp;Then go back up top to the saucer or otherwise get the ball into the flag lane to activate the double bonus. &nbsp;Otherwise, it&rsquo;s generally not worth shooting at any of the four flag standups. &nbsp;Likewise, don&rsquo;t bother to shoot the 5000 recessed standup target unless you&rsquo;re really accurate and just need those points to win - - missed shots to it often drain, and hits to it can drain, &nbsp;too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The top left pair of standup targets and both return lanes add bonus. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t worry about those standups, though, they&rsquo;re not worth shooting the ball into the bumper area rather than through the spinner. &nbsp;You can get some random hits on them when a ball up top fails to land in the saucer and comes down the center.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you find the Wizard in your tournament has flippers too weak to consistently make the UTAD shot through the spinner, or if you get a consistently bad feed out of the flags lane, avoid playing the game if given a choice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If Extra Balls are on, you get it by maxing the bonus at 19000, then shooting the ball to the top through the spinner.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">World Cup [EM &ndash;

slingshot below the S standup advances one button. &nbsp;The left orbit, the top right inverted-J &ldquo;corner kick&rdquo; shot and the &ldquo;super ball&rdquo; shot at the top right just inside the J all light the goal. &nbsp;The corner kick directly feeds the right saucer to score a goal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The top center lane can also score a goal on the plunge; the light alternates on/off on slingshot hits, e.g. note how it goes on and off as the ball is bouncing back and forth slowly settling down towards going through a top lane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Goal count is carried over from ball to ball. &nbsp;Each goal also advances the value of either the left orbit or the corner kick J-shot from 1K to 4K on the left and 1K to 3K on the right; it starts by advancing the left orbit, then the J, and keeps alternating back and forth until both are at maximum value. &nbsp;Those values are also carried over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus multipliers are earned by spelling S-T-A-R. &nbsp;The top lanes each give one letter at a time, the upper stand-up targets and the flipper kickouts each give one as marked. &nbsp;Multipliers go 2X, 3X and 5X for maximum of 180K. &nbsp;Bonus multiplier is not carried over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The outlanes and the spinner are irrelevant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you hold the flippers up when the ball comes to them softly, the ball will roll backwards into the kickers. &nbsp;The kickers tend to shoot the ball out in the general direction of the opposite goal saucer, although not over the buttons en route. &nbsp;If the saucer kickouts go back towards the opposite flipper nicely, you can sometimes get the game to &ldquo;play itself&rdquo; back and forth with the kickouts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy: &nbsp;Since goals and point values are carried over, building both early is key. &nbsp;Go for the left orbit shot to the top and just keep taking STAR letters and goals as long as you can. &nbsp;The game is really about going up top to build things and using the kickouts to collect needed STAR letters and shoot the goal saucers for you. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t shoot at the saucers with the flippers! &nbsp;Never shoot the spinner.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">World Series [EM - Gottlieb, 1972]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;Shoot the &ldquo;single&rdquo;

you&rsquo;ll get a shot, but since the flipper is backwards, you&rsquo;ll need to pay close attention to hit it since your natural reflexes tend to miss. &nbsp;Shots from this upper flipper are the only way to get the ball back to the top lanes, so it&rsquo;s important to learn to make this shot!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing the standup targets and lanes for STEAL advances your bonus multiplier to 2X, then 3X; after that, STEAL scores 50K. &nbsp;If you have runners on base, they advance when you complete STEAL.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The spinner advances runners so long as you spin it enough times to get to the next base, i.e. 4 spins for one base, 8 for 2 bases, 12 for three bases.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">End of ball bonus is 10K per run scored times your multiplier, if any. &nbsp;Bonus goes up to 99 runs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The game has a reversed inlane / outlane on the right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy is to go up top in two steps. &nbsp;First, shoot the left single lane and HOMER targets to make progress and get the ball further up the playfield, then try to get the ball to roll in front of the upper left flipper for a shot to the top. &nbsp;While I would always use the single lane from the right flipper, the left flipper has the option to use the spinner instead of the HOMER targets if spinner shots tend to continue towards the needed upper flipper.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Xenon [SS - Bally, 1980]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD via the left orbit from the right flipper, ramp from the left flipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Right unless the left saucer kickout is safe, in which case Left, especially during multiball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;make sure the ball falls into the top saucer, and try to nudge the kickout so it bounces off the top bumper and goes back in. &nbsp;Try to go over as many of the upper rollover buttons as you can before the ball falls into the saucer; each rollover button hit knocks down one of the drop targets below. &nbsp;Getting the saucer is more important than maxing the number of rollovers, though, so plunge and nudge accordingly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One source of points here is left saucer shots. &nbsp;The saucer, shot via the ramp on the right, starts out worth 5K and goes up in 5K increments through 90K. &nbsp;[When you&rsquo;re above 50K, two of the circle value lights will be illuminated to indicate the saucer&rsquo;s value, e.g. the 15 and 50 lights for a 65K value.] &nbsp;Run the entire sequence and you&rsquo;ll be close to a million, and it&rsquo;s then 90K a shot thereafter. &nbsp;&lsquo;Nuff said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To start multiball, first get the top saucer three times to light the lock. &nbsp;Lock the ball via the ramp, which feeds the left-side saucer. &nbsp;Get the top saucer three more times to start multiball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">During multiball, the same strategy applies: &nbsp;shoot the ramp from the left, up top from the right. &nbsp;Cradle a ball on the right if you can and just do ramp all day from the left flipper if possible. &nbsp;While getting the top &ldquo;X&rdquo; saucer three times lights the spinner for 1K per spin and the outlanes for 50K [assuming specials are set to that value rather than a free game], you&rsquo;ll get more value per shot out of the ramp if the saucer kickout is safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The drop target bank increases your bonus multiplier: &nbsp;one set gives you 2X, the second set 4X. &nbsp;After that, they award 25K, then Extra Ball and Special, so don&rsquo;t bother with them once you have 4X - - they&rsquo;re not worth the effort compared to the ramp. &nbsp;Besides, you get targets from those top rollovers - - that&rsquo;s safer than shooting the drop targets directly. &nbsp;Xenon has &ldquo;super bonus&rdquo; where once you get to 20K or more, 20K in bonus is kept for future balls, and likewise at 40K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Key feed: &nbsp;that kickout from the left saucer. &nbsp;If you can control it, the ramp is the way to go. &nbsp;If you can&rsquo;t, e.g. if the kickout throws the ball into the right slingshot from which it then goes who knows where, you&rsquo;ll need wait until you&rsquo;re in multiball to shoot the ramp. &nbsp;Usually, you can&rsquo;t control it, so you&rsquo;ll be focusing on getting the ball to the right flipper to go up top to start multiball.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">X&rsquo;s and O&rsquo;s [SS - Bally, 1984]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;short plunge so the ball enters below the upper flipper without hitting the switch in the plunger lane right of it and above the entry gate. &nbsp;This shot is on a timer; when it&rsquo;s your turn, you have only 10 seconds or so before the skill shot times out. &nbsp;A successful shot scores 100K. &nbsp;One good competition strategy is to too-short plunge on your first ball and work your way up to plunging just past the gate, noting where on the plunger markers the plunger tip is when you succeed; then use that for balls 2 and 3. &nbsp;You won&rsquo;t get 100K on ball 1, unless you&rsquo;ve already found the sweet spot in a prior game, but as Meat Loaf says, 2 out of 3 ain&rsquo;t bad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Completing the upper drop target 3-bank scores 10K to start but then increases the value of both itself and of the far left lane to the top. &nbsp;The drop bank values go up to 30k, 60K, etc. to 180K (the lights are cumulative); after that, it goes to special, then resets to 10K. &nbsp;The top left lane value starts at 5K and rises to 20K, 40K, etc. to 120K (also cumulative lights), then special. &nbsp;It also resets after special is scored; scoring either special resets both.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bonus is earned by hitting any of the nine standup targets: &nbsp;5K for each, 90K for a full card, which then moves to superbonus and starts a new card. &nbsp;You can get three cards for up to 270K, plus 8 squares on top of that for 350K base bonus. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">The tic-tac-toe squares award extra points if you get three in a row of the same symbol: &nbsp;each 3-in-line is worth 20K, up to 200K per ball. &nbsp;Slingshots and return lanes change which symbol will be awarded for a target hit. &nbsp;Hitting a target you already have when the opposite symbol is lit will </span><span class="c17 c5">change</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;the symbol for that square, meaning you can undo your all-alike pattern by accident!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Card bonus carries over to future balls, including three-in-a-row extras, and will keep the same X or O values you had when you drained. &nbsp;There is no bonus multiplier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Sneaky trick: &nbsp;if you need a center standup target but want the opposite symbol, make a bank shot off either slingshot at it! &nbsp;The slingshot hit will change the symbol, and the bank shot off the sling will usually hit one of the center standups.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The outlanes are non-standard. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a ball save saucer on the lower right: &nbsp;if the ball bounces off the post below the outlane and enters it, it&rsquo;s kicked out over the right flipper where you can get it back into play, and it scores 5K for each X or O on your card. &nbsp;The left side return and outlanes are reversed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you get three three-in-rows on one ball, it lights the second-from-the-left top lane for 50K a shot; five three-in-a-rows on one ball lights the third and innermost top lane for 100K.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A good strategy is UTAD via the outer left lane from the right flipper and towards the upper flipper on the right from the left flipper, where you just keep completing the 3-bank. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll get a bunch of card squares with shots you can&rsquo;t send up top. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t worry about the three-of-the-same unless you&rsquo;re close to getting an all-same card, in which case it&rsquo;s worth making sure they all match for the extra points.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Yukon &ldquo;Special&rdquo; version [EM - Williams, 1971]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;advance all three reels to Yukon, then go for the center reel and the saucers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Skill Shot: &nbsp;hit both the top center advance disk and one of the side disks; hit more than one advance on the side disk if you can nudge for it before the ball drops through the top lane [two or three hits are not uncommon].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Objective: &nbsp;advance all three reels to Yukon. &nbsp;Each reel goes from 1-9, then &ldquo;Yukon.&rdquo; &nbsp;This lights both the center reel and the two top side saucers for a special worth 100,000 points.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The center reel advances in several ways: &nbsp;balls through either return lane, balls through either side lane, hits to the center reel, and any time the ball rolls over the center disk above the reel complex where you plunge the ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The right and left reels only advance in three ways each: &nbsp;shots to the reel, the right and left disks at the top of the game above the entry lanes, and the standup targets that face the flippers below the bumpers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once you score the special, the center reel advances back to 1, but the side reels stay at Yukon. &nbsp;You now need to advance just the center reel to Yukon again to relight the special. &nbsp;There is no limit to how many specials you can score.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Strategy: &nbsp;start by shooting for the side reels. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll find that you rarely need to shoot at the center reel to get it to Yukon the first time around; stray bounces going through the lanes that advance it will generally get you there before you finish both side reels. &nbsp;While you can backhand either side advance target, I find that shooting at the opposite-side reel above is safer. &nbsp;Side reel shots also give the ball the opportunity to drop through a side lane and or return lane to advance the center reel on the way back down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Once you&rsquo;re on your second Yukon lap, you just need center advances. &nbsp;Shooting the center reel risks a down the middle drain; either just shoot the ball up top towards the side reels to set up those random lane advances, or if you shoot for the center reel, try to hit it on the edge. &nbsp;Edge hits usually bounce sideways - - more likely to rattle around and get some lanes, less likely to bounce</span><span class="c5 c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">back towards a center drain. &nbsp;You can also try shooting the ball up the right and left side lanes; I&rsquo;ve done it, but it&rsquo;s a low percentage shot. &nbsp;Shatzing is an option, too, but again it&rsquo;s riskier than the side reels.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Advances score 1k; the top entry lanes and the two saucers score 5k each; outlanes 10K. &nbsp;Bumpers and slings are negligible.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Zig Zag [EM - Williams, 1964]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quickie Version: &nbsp;UTAD, preferably along the sides.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Go-To Flipper: &nbsp;Balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Probably the oldest tournament game you&rsquo;re ever likely to play &ndash;
